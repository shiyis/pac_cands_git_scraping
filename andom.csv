10103404008671134,"Today marks the 8th anniversary of the morning someone in Redding, CT blew Gugsa’s brains out and left him to languish and die on the side of the road before his body was transported to the morgue by a hired contractor.

He wasn’t respected enough to be transported to a hospital and seen by a doctor, even though he wasn’t dead yet when the police arrived.

He wasn’t respected enough to have the medical examiner send an inspector to the scene to collect evidence, as is standard protocol.

The coroner took about 20 photos of his body during the perfunctory autopsy. 5 of these photos were of his right hand, posed as if he was holding a pistol. No photos were taken of his palms or of his left hand, which were also covered in blood. Typically over 100 photos are taken during an autopsy of a suspicious, untimely death. Typically there is a case review that explains how the coroner came to the independent conclusion of manner of death.

The autopsy report is 4 pages long and contains just some basic measurements of his body and it’s organs. No case theory, no discussion at all of a mental health history upon which to conclude the manner of death conclusion.

When asked in deposition, the coroner explained that his rational for “Suicide” was simply that the Redding Police “told him so”.

For eight years, no dash cam or body cam footage has been made available from that night. The cops claim none were on. They don’t deny having the technology (and indeed they definitely did have the technology), but all officers just happened to not remember to turn them on.

Today marks 8 years of lots of somebodies in Redding, Ridgefield, Georgetown and Easton, Connecticut getting to sleep soundly with secrets about the murder of a Black boy on the night of April 4-5, 2014.

Condolences are appreciated, but what I would really appreciate are:

(1) Tips and Leads at info@justice4abe.com

(2) Someone to contact me from law enforcement with authority to interrogate all the white men with knowledge of this night. Specific, identifiable, known individuals with actual knowledge, who have NEVER been formally interrogated. Men with names on a list I can easily provide to anyone motivated. A list that starts with: Stephen, Don, Mark, Tim, Davey, and others…. A list no one has followed up on.

And until those dreams come true… I could use a investigative reporter who wants to work on “Serial” type podcast to open Pandora’s box and find truth and accountability.

The Bible says ask and ye shall receive. Here goes nothing.","Today marks the 8th anniversary of the morning someone in Redding, CT blew Gugsa’s brains out and left him to languish and die on the side of the road before his body was transported to the morgue by a hired contractor.

10103154935984794,"The night the murder video of Adam Toledo was released, Jason, a former student whom I had taught in 7th and 8th grades over 10 years ago, texted me to accept his Cash App.

6 months ago, Jason had been in a “tight spot” and asked me for $30, which I willingly lent him. Now, he was paying me back, but I noticed he had sent $35. I told him he made a mistake, and he replied “$5 interest.” “There’s no interest between us,” I retorted, but he said playfully, “Do not send it back; I will block you lmao.”

This act may not seem revolutionary, but, for many who knew Jason as a 13 year old, they may be surprised it’s coming from him. See Jason was one of the most frequently suspended students in a Bronx public MS that had a lot of suspensions. For “defiance,” bullying, and violence, Jason spent 7th & 8th grade in and out of our school. Some of the students (and teachers) were happy at this fact; despite his smile and charm, depending on the situation, his 13-year old self wasn’t always easy to interact with. But, even then, if one looked beyond his disciplinary record and at the teenager who wanted nothing more than approval and success, they would have known that he (nor anyone) is a lost cause.

One day, I had left my computer in the classroom, and Jason & another student (Tevin) took pictures of themselves with the webcam (first pic). I could have written it up, but all I thought about was how the world saw my students & how it would react to them. The fear that jolted my heart whenever I received a late-night call at home: were my students safe? were they the victims of violence? could they have caused harm to others? Every weekend, when I said “see you next week,” it wasn’t a mundane farewell but a prayer, a public appeal to the universe to return them to us safely.

A 7th grade student can be murdered by the police and then publicly smeared to justify it because he is seen as disposable. He is just his environment, of which he is born into; he is forever his worst mistake, of which teens make many; he is pathology and incapable of change. Starved of resources in a special education classroom, criminalized with punitive discipline, disposable in life and death. And so the emphasis that Adam was unarmed should not be to show his perfectability. He was a human, and whether 13 or 35, allowed to err & make mistakes without having his life irrevocably discarded; allowed to grow & surprise & smile with interest like Jason. That he was denied that, that he was ripped away while unarmed, breaks me, and only further confirms that this can never be reformed. #JusticeForAdamToledo","The night the murder video of Adam Toledo was released, Jason, a former student whom I had taught in 7th and 8th grades over 10 years ago, texted me to accept his Cash App.

Auntie: Andomiye, can you see to have Adhanom buried in Arlington Cemetery?
Me: huh?
Auntie: He was a veteran, so I was thinking he should be there.
Me: ...but he didn’t “fight for” the US.
Auntie: Yes, but he still fought for his country. They may allow it; just try & make some calls

10103106729081814,"On 9/7/2001, my uncle, Adhanom Gebremariam, in the US for the 1st time for medical treatment, visited some of NYCs famous sights.

As he stood on top of NYC, he had no idea how the next 2 weeks would drastically alter the world and his life.

4 days later, the WTC was no more. 7 days after the 9/11 attacks, with the world's eyes on the US, the #Eritrean regime arrested 11 members of the #G15, the group of 15 gov’t officials who had called for the implementation of the constitution & for elections to be held.

My uncle had been 1 of the signers of the G15s open letter, but, being here in NY, he was “safe” from indefinite detention.

In many Eritrean homes, there are rooms that wait, for the migrants, refugees, exiles, family members to arrive. The empty room that would later fill an endless flow, Adhanom took over.

My parents told me he was a liberator, but, at first, he was just an uncle, one who happened to be the latest to occupy that room.

And he confused me initially: how could someone be so effervescent considering the lives he had taken & those he was forced to leave behind?

I saw & learned that Adhanom was a dreamer, who effused positivity and joy with every (sometimes labored) breath, despite his tragic circumstances (see video of him, a true MV/Bronxite, dancing merengue on Xmas 🤣).

He imagined and sacrificed for a liberated Eritrea. And when the regime, made up of his former comrades, turned its back on the dream, on the G15, on him, Adhanom never gave up the hope that one day he would freely return to the land he fought for. His optimism that he would see his family & kids, whom he was torn away from, never waned, even after 20 years.

“We are Eritreans,” he’d tell me. “We will always resist.”

I’m forever thankful to have learned from Adhanom, to have been supported by him, and, in some capacity, to have struggled with him.

He was a guiding light for our community, a library of knowledge, & an exemplar for struggle & action.

He fought in the field for two decades, experienced some sense of normalcy during the ‘90s, & then was exiled for the last two decades. He gave his life for his homeland, so the fact that he won’t ever see a free #Eritrea pains me deeply. May he finally find peace. He deserved so much better. #RIP","On 9/7/2001, my uncle, Adhanom Gebremariam, in the US for the 1st time for medical treatment, visited some of NYCs famous sights.

10103036174882994,"*Urgent Action Alert* #BrandonBernard is set to be executed tomorrow at 6 PM...on #InternationalHumanRightsDay no less. Everyone, please follow the actions on the following pics to #HelpSaveBrandon.

Brandon Bernard was 18 years old when first incarcerated and sentenced to death as an accomplice. He is now 40 years old has been on death row for 20 years. We must #AbolishTheDeathPenalty and recognize that it should never be applied in any case, but it’s important to note that Brandon did not kill anyone nor was he involved in the planning of the botched robbery gone wrong. The majority of surviving jurors for his case do not view the death penalty as a necessary “punishment.” His prosecutor has too called for “mercy.”

Since Trump ended the federal stay on executions this July (the first President in 17 years to do so), 8 people have been put to death. His administration plans to execute 5 more people during this lame-duck session. A President hasn’t proceeded with federal executions during a lame duck session since 1889, when the outgoing Cleveland administration executed Richard Smith, a Choctaw man.

Brandon Bernard’s life matters. Let’s all do everything in our power to stop this racist state murder.","*Urgent Action Alert* #BrandonBernard is set to be executed tomorrow at 6 PM...on #InternationalHumanRightsDay no less.

10102947043423154,"Year 6: Every anniversary of my father’s death I replay the day in my mind: going to school in the morning, receiving an ominous call from my sister 5th period while talking to Anjelei, hurriedly driving from the Heights to MV hoping that the call had been about anything but death, and seeing all the cars parked outside my house knowing what must have transpired.

I had been essentially preparing for a year, as my father battled Stage 4 #coloncancer, so crying didn’t come to me when I was in my house. The most difficult thing was seeing and hearing the distinctive shrieks and wails as waves of family members trickled in. I thought of my father’s siblings who would be arriving the next day from Saudi Arabia and California and knew that I wouldn’t be able to handle the cries they would unleash from pain suppressed over long-distance flights.

September 10, 2014 is a day I could’ve never scripted. In fact, one of the most powerful moments of my teaching career surprisingly occurred that night. Because I had rushed out of school, I happened to be absent to a nondescript, end-of-day, whole-school meeting. It was something that had happened before and was no cause for alarm to any other students or teachers. One student, Rachel, an 8th-grader who I was teaching for the third straight year and who had just turned 13 the previous day, had noticed my absence, however, and she connected it with a difference she had observed in my general affect the past couple days. That night, hours after the meeting I was absent from concluded, Rachel called me (for the first time ever) and asked me what was going on and if everything was okay. I was floored. My father had passed away during lunch, and Rachel had sensed something amiss. Even more amazing than her empathic ability was that Rachel acted, and she, my teenage student, sent me positivity on one of the most chaotic days of my life.

I never envisioned my father slowly withering away, afflicted with disease. He was our strength, a revolutionary...rendered totally dependent on the care of his family. Like many Eritrean immigrants of his era, he wasn’t super excited when I told him I was becoming a NYC teacher. He just couldn’t know, and, to be honest, neither could I. I first taught Rachel in 2012, and, after a turbulent year in which she challenged everything in my class, she became one of my closest students (second pic). And though I was her teacher, she supported me from 2012 on: on the day of my father’s death, in my classroom, when I ran for Congress. My father never met Rachel or any of my students. I wish he knew how much they impacted us.","Year 6: Every anniversary of my father’s death I replay the day in my mind: going to school in the morning, receiving an ominous call from my sister 5th period while talking to Anjelei, hurriedly driving from the Heights to MV hoping that the call had been about anything but death, and seeing all the cars parked outside my house knowing what must have transpired.

It was something that had happened before and was no cause for alarm to any other students or teachers. One student, Rachel, an 8th-grader who I was teaching for the third straight year and who had just turned 13 the previous day, had noticed my absence, however, and she connected it with a difference she had observed in my general affect the past couple days. That night, hours after the meeting I was absent from concluded, Rachel called me (for the first time ever) and asked me what was going on and if everything was okay. I was floored. My father had passed away during lunch, and Rachel had sensed something amiss. Even more amazing than her empathic ability was that Rachel acted, and she, my teenage student, sent me positivity on one of the most chaotic days of my life.

I never envisioned my father slowly withering away, afflicted with disease. He was our strength, a revolutionary...rendered totally dependent on the care of his family. Like many Eritrean immigrants of his era, he wasn’t super excited when I told him I was becoming a NYC teacher. He just couldn’t know, and, to be honest, neither could I. I first taught Rachel in 2012, and, after a turbulent year in which she challenged everything in my class, she became one of my closest students (second pic). And though I was her teacher, she supported me from 2012 on: on the day of my father’s death, in my classroom, when I ran for Congress. My father never met Rachel or any of my students. I wish he knew how much they impacted us.",,,2020-09-10 19:46:00,,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-9/118784859_10102947042979044_3498682436953380437_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_e15_fr_q65&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=110474&efg=eyJpIjoidCJ9&_nc_ohc=MZjysXbx2S0AX84eWNc&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AT-oGVrckTk5qr3RJkXBNmEM1LLglTlGsS4MVpMK0YpAbw&oe=62D36A8D&manual_redirect=1,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-9/118784859_10102947042979044_3498682436953380437_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_e15_q65_s320x320&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=110474&efg=eyJpIjoidCJ9&_nc_ohc=MZjysXbx2S0AX84eWNc&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AT8uma3tFPbYZrT_74OGLkKKrZjmt6D-vgduMi8Z55AWqQ&oe=62D36A8D,"['https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-9/118784859_10102947042979044_3498682436953380437_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_e15_fr_q65&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=110474&efg=eyJpIjoidCJ9&_nc_ohc=MZjysXbx2S0AX84eWNc&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AT-oGVrckTk5qr3RJkXBNmEM1LLglTlGsS4MVpMK0YpAbw&oe=62D36A8D&manual_redirect=1', 'https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-9/119250061_10102947042954094_4315370825076888694_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_e15_fr_q65&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=110474&efg=eyJpIjoidCJ9&_nc_ohc=54wl-Qr5HvsAX_GNetw&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AT9r3ep8HcqazKtpnXO_saAzJUIR_tBA9DbvnpKqq54U7g&oe=62D0D2A7&manual_redirect=1']","['No photo description available.', 'No photo description available.']","['https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-9/118784859_10102947042979044_3498682436953380437_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_e15_q65_s320x320&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=110474&efg=eyJpIjoidCJ9&_nc_ohc=MZjysXbx2S0AX84eWNc&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AT8uma3tFPbYZrT_74OGLkKKrZjmt6D-vgduMi8Z55AWqQ&oe=62D36A8D', 'https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-9/119250061_10102947042954094_4315370825076888694_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_e15_q65_s320x320&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=110474&efg=eyJpIjoidCJ9&_nc_ohc=54wl-Qr5HvsAX_GNetw&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AT-B7BFRj897pruL4bcnhPVJ7NwZ83B7dQsqv44u_did-A&oe=62D0D2A7']","['No photo description available.', 'No photo description available.']",,,,,,,,,,207,19,0,https://facebook.com/andom/posts/10102947043423154,,"[{'link': '/story.php?story_fbid=10102947043423154&id=301331', 'text': 'More'}, {'link': '/hashtag/coloncancer?_ft_=qid.-6139378808820464287%3Amf_story_key.10102947043423154%3Atop_level_post_id.10102947043423154%3Atl_objid.10102947043423154%3Acontent_owner_id_new.301331%3Athrowback_story_fbid.10102947043423154%3Aphoto_attachments_list.%5B10102947042974054%2C10102947042949104%5D%3Aphoto_id.10102947042974054%3Astory_location.4%3Astory_attachment_style.album%3Asty.22%3Aent_attachement_type.PhotoSetAttachment%3Aapp_id.6628568379%3Apos.1%3Aprofile_id.301331%3Aprofile_relationship_type.6%3Aactrs.301331%3Athid.301331%3A306061129499414%3A2%3A0%3A1656658799%3A-1923637685647332052%3A%3A%3Aftmd_400706.111111l&__tn__=%2As-R', 'text': '#coloncancer'}, {'link': '/story.php?story_fbid=10102947043423154&id=301331&_ft_=qid.-6139378808820464287%3Amf_story_key.10102947043423154%3Atop_level_post_id.10102947043423154%3Atl_objid.10102947043423154%3Acontent_owner_id_new.301331%3Athrowback_story_fbid.10102947043423154%3Aphoto_attachments_list.%5B10102947042974054%2C10102947042949104%5D%3Aphoto_id.10102947042974054%3Astory_location.4%3Astory_attachment_style.album%3Asty.22%3Aent_attachement_type.PhotoSetAttachment%3Aapp_id.6628568379%3Apos.1%3Aprofile_id.301331%3Aprofile_relationship_type.6%3Aactrs.301331%3Athid.301331%3A306061129499414%3A2%3A0%3A1656658799%3A-1923637685647332052%3A%3A%3Aftmd_400706.111111l&__tn__=%2C%3B', 'text': 'More'}]",301331,Andom Ghebreghiorgis,https://facebook.com/andom?_ft_=qid.-6139378808820464287%3Amf_story_key.10102947043423154%3Atop_level_post_id.10102947043423154%3Atl_objid.10102947043423154%3Acontent_owner_id_new.301331%3Athrowback_story_fbid.10102947043423154%3Aphoto_attachments_list.%5B10102947042974054%2C10102947042949104%5D%3Aphoto_id.10102947042974054%3Astory_location.4%3Astory_attachment_style.album%3Asty.22%3Aent_attachement_type.PhotoSetAttachment%3Aapp_id.6628568379%3Apos.1%3Aprofile_id.301331%3Aprofile_relationship_type.6%3Aactrs.301331%3Athid.301331%3A306061129499414%3A2%3A0%3A1656658799%3A-1923637685647332052%3A%3A%3Aftmd_400706.111111l&__tn__=C-R,False,,,,,,,True,,,,,,,,,,[],False,

Grassroots Al-Quds’ Funding Gap

The COVID-19 crisis and lockdown halted all of Grassroots Al-Quds' tours and book sales to tourists and visitors. This loss of income created a $40,000 gap in their budget for 2020. Through appeals and donating 10,000 from staff salaries, they closed the gap to $10,000!

How you can support:

Here’s how you can help Grassroots AlQuds to close the remaining gap and be able to continue its critical work.

10102926747256834,"Unbelievable that it was year ago today I made my first TV appearance of the campaign.

Hearing Grace (reporter from NY1) butcher my first name after spending mad long pre-show trying to perfect my last name 🙂, reminds me of a huge missed opportunity in the campaign. The pronunciation guide for my name should have definitely been Andom (rhymes with Condom) Ghebreghiorgis (just say Ghetto-gorgeous). As someone said on Twitter, Condom Ghettogorgeous is an amazing drag name, and honestly it’s the biggest regret of the campaign/my life/I may just never talk to Christian or Cynthia ever again for not marketing it 😂 jk

In all seriousness though, this interview was such a big moment for the campaign. The night before Katherine Brezler and Christian peppered me with questions for hours (they knew how important this interview would be). I normally don’t get nervous before events, but, not gonna lie, I was a little bit as I drove down to NY1’s office with Kat. I feared they’d ask me a gotchu question or twist my words. Fortunately, the interview with NY1 ended up going really well, and, like everything with the campaign, it wouldn’t have been possible without the folks behind the scenes putting in work and helping out. Tbh all our interviews went smoothly on the campaign, for the most part, but I’ll always cherish this first one. Not only bc Adam Ghebregoreyus’ name got out there (shout out to Adam), but bc the hard work and preparation with Christian and Kat for this interview (and also Teddy Goff Kalindi Dominique Eldar and Ted Fertik, early on) so clearly paid off.","Unbelievable that it was year ago today I made my first TV appearance of the campaign.

10102882078408564,"I had gone days without my father appearing in my mind, but I naturally thought of him on July 7, his and my mother’s birthday. I excitedly wished my mother a happy 71st but then felt some shame for not having thought of my father the previous days. I couldn’t believe that someone who had such a huge presence in my life had been reduced to fleeting moments of remembrance.⁣
⁣
After my father passed in 2014, the space he used to take up was replaced by a fear that I would fail to properly honor his life or, even worse, would forget how he lived, laughed, and dreamed before cancer had taken over his body. I made plans to keep his memory alive for myself, but, as time has made the memory more and more distant, the energy of my efforts has unfortunately declined with it.⁣
⁣
In this moment of uprising and liberation, I wonder about our ability to keep the energy: for the protests to keep going, the fire [that we don’t see] burning. When will people, if not already, go through their day without recognizing the importance of #BlackLivesMatter? When did I stop the daily thinking of my late father? ⁣
⁣
He and all the Eritreans in the diaspora spent decades struggling for a liberation they never knew they would see, and then, for my father, after independence, another couple of decades for a free, democratic Eritrea that he didn’t live long enough to witness. I was always amazed by their unwavering determination, the ascetic stubbornness that prevented them from losing sight of their freedom dream and normalizing their privileged position. Liberation was always a process and a product.⁣
⁣
On July 7, we went from cake for my mother to the cemetery of my father. I looked for tombstones with Eritrean and Ethiopian names (there are lots) and at the engraved faces of kids who never were able to finish high school (even more); there were rows and rows of tombstones past my father when, at one point, he used to be last. His age is frozen in time, but my mother keeps blowing more and more candles. No better way to keep the fire still burning.","I had gone days without my father appearing in my mind, but I naturally thought of him on July 7, his and my mother’s birthday.

I’m receiving some praise on Twitter but it’s really all thanks to #TeamAndom and your tireless efforts in what was a difficult race. We did it! We helped unseat Engel ✊🏾⁣
⁣
* 2,079 absentee ballots have been returned in the Bronx and 19,249 have been returned in Westchester as of this morning. Ballots are still trickling in, but Engel would need to take nearly 80% of the absentee ballots to close the gap.",,,2020-06-24

With pearly-white teeth and distinctive scars, this “Welcome to Eritrea” person was unforgettable.

In fact, he existed out of time, a symbol of our homeland, smiling, hopeful, forever.⁣

In the early-2010s, I found out that the young man on our posters, the Beni-Amer boy, had been killed during Eritrea’s liberation struggle. Even though his death had been some 45 years before, I was crushed as if it had just happened. Because of his ubiquity, his visibility, I felt like I knew the Beni-Amer boy, but, in reality, I knew almost nothing of him at all. ⁣

I am surrounded by invisible martyrs whose stories I know much clearer than that of the Beni-Amer boy, but, unfortunately, I don’t know their faces. My uncle killed in the struggle in late 70s. My cousin, a teenage refugee, murdered by human traffickers in Egypt in 2013. They are people whom I’ve never met, never seen, but whose hopes were simple I know: a #FreeEritrea. #EritreanMartyrsDay and #WorldRefugeeDay are fittingly the same day, and we recognize for our people it is the same struggle that continues.

It's fitting that Eritrean Martyrs' Day and World Refugee Day occupy the same time. Our uncles and aunts fought Ethiopian aggression, dying so that we wouldn't be refugees in our own land, yet now Eritreans are martyrs to refugeedom, statistical sidenotes to Syria as we are locked in camps, butchered with impunity, and killed at sea.

My cousin Maaza, whose blood I share but whose face is unknown to me, I know your smile was shaped by the same dreams all humans have: for freedom, for a better life, maybe one day to get married. Sometimes at night, when I close my eyes to sleep, I feel our hearts connecting in the Asmara darkness of my mind. I'm sorry how you suffered, that it didn't pass. We honor the life you had and that which you didn't get to lead today and everyday.

4 years ago, my teenage cousin, a refugee from Eritrea, was kidnapped in Egypt and held for ransom; after the ransom was paid, she was murdered, and her organs harvested and then sold. She is one of thousands of faceless Eritreans who has met this fate because of a callously non-existent regional and international apparatus of refugee protection.

It's fitting that Eritrean Martyrs' Day and World Refugee Day occupy the same time. Our uncles and aunts fought Ethiopian aggression, dying so that we wouldn't be refugees in our own land, yet now Eritreans are martyrs to refugeedom, statistical sidenotes to Syria as we are locked in camps, butchered with impunity, and killed at sea. Death without recognition, concern, or justice.

10102852538736304,"In a country with a long history of #lynching black bodies, the epidemic of “quick call suicides” represents another (insidious) way in which police can brutalize the dead and traumatize the living by denying investigations & justice, while covering for white supremacists who never stopped hunting Black people.

With multiple lynchings and “quick call suicides” across the country over the last couple of weeks, it’s past time to investigate the investigators who bury the deaths of Black people.

Here’s one such story of the Dabela family and their tragic loss. Gugsa “Abe” Dabela, 35, was a young lawyer with a promising future when he was gunned down on the side of the road late one night in April 2014 in Redding, CT. Abe was driving to his home in Redding after a night out at a local pub, when he was in a slow speed, rollover car accident. The Redding Police Department (RPD) allege they found him suffering from a single gunshot wound to the back of the head, yet no crime scene investigator was called to the scene. Instead, within hours the RPD issued a press release declaring the gunshot wound self-inflicted and never initiated a homicide investigation.⁣ ⁣

Some of the suspicious circumstances surrounding Abe’s death and the handling of the investigation by the RPD & the Danbury State’s Attorney are:⁣
• The police claim that Abe shot himself with his own gun, but DNA recovered from its trigger does not match Abe⁣.
• Abe’s hands were never tested for gunshot residue, and, when his jacket was tested, the test was negative⁣.
• Abe’s jacket had a muddy footprint on the back.⁣
• The bullet submitted to the crime lab had no DNA/blood on it⁣.
• Neither the bullet nor the casing could be positively matched to Abe’s gun.⁣
• No body/dashcam footage from any officer or police vehicle at the scene has ever been released⁣.
• 6 months after Abe’s death, the medical examiner ruled Abe’s death a suicide based solely on statements from the police⁣.
• Both the first responding officer and the police chief allegedly left town on the day of Abe’s death, and neither has ever met with the family⁣.
• The State’s Attorney released two highly unusual public statements regarding Abe’s death: first, he stated that there is no evidence of a conspiracy relating to Abe’s death, and second, he declared that Abe’s death was not a homicide.⁣ ⁣

In the 6 years following Abe’s death, Abe’s parents have tirelessly sought justice for their son and repeatedly called for the State to conduct a thorough, unbiased investigation, but they have repeatedly been shut down, silenced, and stonewalled. ⁣ ⁣

To everyone in the Dabela family, I love you and am with you in this fight always. #Justice4Abe #Justice4All #BlackLivesMatter","In a country with a long history of #lynching black bodies, the epidemic of “quick call suicides” represents another (insidious) way in which police can brutalize the dead and traumatize the living by denying investigations & justice, while covering for white supremacists who never stopped hunting Black people.

With multiple lynchings and “quick call suicides” across the country over the last couple of weeks, it’s past time to investigate the investigators who bury the deaths of Black people.

Here’s one such story of the Dabela family and their tragic loss. Gugsa “Abe” Dabela, 35, was a young lawyer with a promising future when he was gunned down on the side of the road late one night in April 2014 in Redding, CT. Abe was driving to his home in Redding after a night out at a local pub, when he was in a slow speed, rollover car accident. The Redding Police Department (RPD) allege they found him suffering from a single gunshot wound to the back of the head, yet no crime scene investigator was called to the scene. Instead, within hours the RPD issued a press release declaring the gunshot wound self-inflicted and never initiated a homicide investigation.⁣ ⁣

Some of the suspicious circumstances surrounding Abe’s death and the handling of the investigation by the RPD & the Danbury State’s Attorney are:⁣
• The police claim that Abe shot himself with his own gun, but DNA recovered from its trigger does not match Abe⁣.
• Abe’s hands were never tested for gunshot residue, and, when his jacket was tested, the test was negative⁣.
• Abe’s jacket had a muddy footprint on the back.⁣
• The bullet submitted to the crime lab had no DNA/blood on it⁣.
• Neither the bullet nor the casing could be positively matched to Abe’s gun.⁣
• No body/dashcam footage from any officer or police vehicle at the scene has ever been released⁣.
• 6 months after Abe’s death, the medical examiner ruled Abe’s death a suicide based solely on statements from the police⁣.
• Both the first responding officer and the police chief allegedly left town on the day of Abe’s death, and neither has ever met with the family⁣.
• The State’s Attorney released two highly unusual public statements regarding Abe’s death: first, he stated that there is no evidence of a conspiracy relating to Abe’s death, and second, he declared that Abe’s death was not a homicide.⁣ ⁣

In the 6 years following Abe’s death, Abe’s parents have tirelessly sought justice for their son and repeatedly called for the State to conduct a thorough, unbiased investigation, but they have repeatedly been shut down, silenced, and stonewalled. ⁣ ⁣

10102839461508174,"As many of you are aware, on Thursday night, I and hundreds of others were arrested at a protest in Mott Haven. *CW* Video: Police brutality

Over two hundred cops kettled us on E. 136th St between Brook Ave. and Brown Pl. at around 7:55 PM. We sang and chanted in the enclosed space for some time. At 8:10 PM, while holding the front line at Brook Ave., cops in the back pushed into the crowd with their bikes and packed us into an increasingly tight space. Comrades, crunched up on another, yelled, “You’re gonna kill people” & “I can’t breathe.” I hopped onto a car hood and tried to help folks into the sidewalk.

It was terrible, unexpected, unbelievable. In the videos, over a cacophony of screams of pain, cries for help, and batons hitting bones, you will see vicious acts of police brutality: cops indiscriminately *pepper spray into a crowd of people unable to escape; cops jump on a car and violently swing batons down at the crowd; a white-shirt baton-check a comrade in the chest for no reason; and other acts of police violence. A woman went into labor amidst/because of the chaos. Hundreds of protesters, beaten, bruised, and traumatized, were cuffed and herded to the center of E. 136th St.

It was a surreal scene: dozens of people from the neighborhood were outside breaking curfew watching us be arrested for breaking a curfew that we missed because we were trapped and brutalized by the NYPD in a protest against police brutality.

I’m zip-tied around 8:27 PM (right as my IG live ends). We sat in the center of 136th St for roughly 45 minutes. Numerous protestors were sitting with blood dripping down from head wounds. A young woman passed out next to me. The police responded slowly but picked up urgency when she started convulsing in seizure. 3 cops and an EMT hurriedly carried her to ambulance. Her friend cried loudly, handcuffed near the sidewalk. A woman who lives on south side of E. 136th, filming the unresponsive protestors carried away, cried as well as she filmed the scene from her house.

What the police did in the South Bronx that night was a planned, coordinated attack. The violence and brutality were intentional, and the confusion that followed our arrests was purposeful as well: to make us suffer as much as possible.

Many of us were transferred Queens Criminal Court in an unbelievably hot police bus. We remained on the bus for hours before joining other comrades outside the Court. There were hundreds of people waiting on a line that barely moved. We waited outside all night while the rain came down on us. A young protestor, who couldn’t have been more than 90 pounds, was wearing a short dress not suited for the chilly night and rain. She shivered and cried, pleading for her friend’s jacket, previously confiscated by the police, but they refused to give it to her though they were holding the bag of arrestees’ items in their hand.

At maybe 3 AM, some of us are transferred to Brooklyn. Comrades flipped out; we had been waiting in line for hours and still hadn’t been processed. The police deliberately attacked us, prevented protestors from leaving, and intentionally arrested everyone, yet did not even have the capacity/processes/or desire to handle that many people arrested. It was wasteful all around. Dozens of the arresting officers just stood by our side waiting in the line with us. $$$ well spent

I go to Brooklyn and ended up waiting in a cell there for roughly 12 hours. They made me take my fingerprints 4 times (“there’s an issue with Albany; it’s not receiving your info”). They continuously lied and hung up the phone on my family. My arresting officer had told my brother that I was released from Queens at 1 AM and on the subway home. Why? How?

I am released from Brooklyn at 3 PM Friday afternoon. Nearly 19 hrs. No food or phone calls given. Constant lies, no communication, & no urgency from the police.

Thank you to The Bronx Defenders, Good Call, National Lawyers Guild, and friends & family for your help in invoking my rights and getting me released. Thanks for all the messages (I haven’t yet replied to) from friends as well.

And shout out to jail support for taking care of me when I was released. I quickly went from being super angry to happy to see friendly, caring faces.

Volunteer if you can!",,,2020-06-06 19:49:00,,,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t15.5256-10/103495378_10102839462665854_3448894316396896334_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_e15_p320x320_q65&_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=ccf8b3&efg=eyJpIjoidCJ9&_nc_ohc=dI9eFj-ehW8AX9YkuHX&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AT-kop5GE5CsBWVOcbYXFib1eeOGeJrfO106T0_-xsdI2Q&oe=62B11AC9,[],[],['https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t15.5256-10/103495378_10102839462665854_3448894316396896334_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_e15_p320x320_q65&_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=ccf8b3&efg=eyJpIjoidCJ9&_nc_ohc=dI9eFj-ehW8AX9YkuHX&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AT-kop5GE5CsBWVOcbYXFib1eeOGeJrfO106T0_-xsdI2Q&oe=62B11AC9'],[None],https://video-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t42.9040-2/10000000_246289139997698_3491365253648281557_n.mp4?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=985c63&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6InN2ZV9zZCJ9&_nc_ohc=wTGpRWSkzIIAX-cEmsC&_nc_rml=0&_nc_ht=video-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AT-4YCaVh-eh7551kLRRA7H8Rz97bzad0bcOIoyIAoArJQ&oe=62ACEC8F,,,10102839458603994,,,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t15.5256-10/103495378_10102839462665854_3448894316396896334_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_e15_p320x320_q65&_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=ccf8b3&efg=eyJpIjoidCJ9&_nc_ohc=dI9eFj-ehW8AX9YkuHX&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AT-kop5GE5CsBWVOcbYXFib1eeOGeJrfO106T0_-xsdI2Q&oe=62B11AC9,,,322,98,345,https://facebook.com/andom/posts/10102839461508174,,"[{'link': '/story.php?story_fbid=10102839461508174&id=301331', 'text': 'More'}, {'link': '/story.php?story_fbid=10102839461508174&id=301331&_ft_=qid.-6139374685742949306%3Amf_story_key.10102839461508174%3Atop_level_post_id.10102839461508174%3Atl_objid.10102839461508174%3Acontent_owner_id_new.301331%3Athrowback_story_fbid.10102839461508174%3Apage_id.338038119888%3Astory_location.4%3Astory_attachment_style.video_inline%3Aott.AX9_C8a955Gznfx8%3Avideo_id.10102839458603994%3Asty.22%3Aent_attachement_type.VideoAttachment%3Aapp_id.6628568379%3Apos.1%3Apage_insights.%7B%22338038119888%22%3A%7B%22page_id%22%3A338038119888%2C%22page_id_type%22%3A%22page%22%2C%22actor_id%22%3A301331%2C%22dm%22%3A%7B%22isShare%22%3A0%2C%22originalPostOwnerID%22%3A0%7D%2C%22psn%22%3A%22EntStatusCreationStory%22%2C%22role%22%3A16%2C%22sl%22%3A4%7D%2C%22100062949235274%22%3A%7B%22page_id%22%3A100062949235274%2C%22page_id_type%22%3A%22page%22%2C%22actor_id%22%3A301331%2C%22dm%22%3A%7B%22isShare%22%3A0%2C%22originalPostOwnerID%22%3A0%7D%2C%22psn%22%3A%22EntStatusCreationStory%22%2C%22role%22%3A16%2C%22sl%22%3A4%7D%2C%22100069766796779%22%3A%7B%22page_id%22%3A100069766796779%2C%22page_id_type%22%3A%22page%22%2C%22actor_id%22%3A301331%2C%22dm%22%3A%7B%22isShare%22%3A0%2C%22originalPostOwnerID%22%3A0%7D%2C%22psn%22%3A%22EntStatusCreationStory%22%2C%22role%22%3A16%2C%22sl%22%3A4%7D%7D%3Aprofile_id.301331%3Aprofile_relationship_type.6%3Aactrs.301331%3Atds_flgs.3%3Athid.301331%3A306061129499414%3A2%3A1577865600%3A1609487999%3A7205374387160137047%3A%3A%3Aftmd_400706.111111l&__tn__=%2C%3B', 'text': 'More'}]",301331,Andom Ghebreghiorgis,https://facebook.com/andom?_ft_=qid.-6139374685742949306%3Amf_story_key.10102839461508174%3Atop_level_post_id.10102839461508174%3Atl_objid.10102839461508174%3Acontent_owner_id_new.301331%3Athrowback_story_fbid.10102839461508174%3Apage_id.338038119888%3Astory_location.4%3Astory_attachment_style.video_inline%3Aott.AX9_C8a955Gznfx8%3Avideo_id.10102839458603994%3Asty.22%3Aent_attachement_type.VideoAttachment%3Aapp_id.6628568379%3Apos.1%3Apage_insights.%7B%22338038119888%22%3A%7B%22page_id%22%3A338038119888%2C%22page_id_type%22%3A%22page%22%2C%22actor_id%22%3A301331%2C%22dm%22%3A%7B%22isShare%22%3A0%2C%22originalPostOwnerID%22%3A0%7D%2C%22psn%22%3A%22EntStatusCreationStory%22%2C%22role%22%3A16%2C%22sl%22%3A4%7D%2C%22100062949235274%22%3A%7B%22page_id%22%3A100062949235274%2C%22page_id_type%22%3A%22page%22%2C%22actor_id%22%3A301331%2C%22dm%22%3A%7B%22isShare%22%3A0%2C%22originalPostOwnerID%22%3A0%7D%2C%22psn%22%3A%22EntStatusCreationStory%22%2C%22role%22%3A16%2C%22sl%22%3A4%7D%2C%22100069766796779%22%3A%7B%22page_id%22%3A100069766796779%2C%22page_id_type%22%3A%22page%22%2C%22actor_id%22%3A301331%2C%22dm%22%3A%7B%22isShare%22%3A0%2C%22originalPostOwnerID%22%3A0%7D%2C%22psn%22%3A%22EntStatusCreationStory%22%2C%22role%22%3A16%2C%22sl%22%3A4%7D%7D%3Aprofile_id.301331%3Aprofile_relationship_type.6%3Aactrs.301331%3Atds_flgs.3%3Athid.301331%3A306061129499414%3A2%3A1577865600%3A1609487999%3A7205374387160137047%3A%3A%3Aftmd_400706.111111l&__tn__=C-R,False,,,,,,,True,,,,,,,338038119888,,,[],False,
10102830750425254,"I decided to run for Congress because I knew that our needs in District 16 weren't being met. I lived it growing up in MV and teaching in the Bronx. I saw it through the sometimes beautiful, sometimes traumatic perspective of triple-consciousness my first-gen #Eritrea|n-American self experienced this country (quad-consciousness if you include long-suffering Knicks fan). I knew we needed better representation that understood the varying challenges in our socio-economically and racially-diverse district. I hoped we could be that representation.

Unfortunately, there is no longer a path for me to represent my community in Congress. That's why I'm suspending my campaign and endorsing my fellow Bronx educator, Jamaal Bowman for Congress. Jamaal is a committed progressive and the best choice in this race to defeat Eliot Engel and the old, failed politics he stands for. There are 23 days until the primary—more than ever, it's clear that Engel needs to go. If you support #TeamAndom, support Jamaal.

Yes, this was a difficult decision, but I’m empowered by those who have shaped [and continue to shape] me. My father grew up in the slums of Hadish Adi. My mother came to NY with not a penny to her name. My students struggled in under-resourced classrooms, overpoliced hallways, and disinvested communities but were always militantly optimistic. And the love that people - many who barely even know me - have shown throughout this campaign certainly is enough to restore one’s faith in humanity should our system and circumstances cause us to lose hope [some of y'all were haters but it's all good 🙂 ]

I'm so thankful for all of you. I'm not going to do special shout-outs b/c I'm going to get myself in trouble, but I really appreciate the support so much. Don't worry about texting me or calling me asking me how I'm doing. I'm good! Instead, sign up for a campaign's phone bank and call with them to check in on folks; forward some good decarceral literature to your friends and family; go to a Bronx/Upper Manhattan DSA meeting or volunteer with One Day Seyoum. There's so much work to do, and it won't be easy.

But I'm forever motivated by what I saw in this campaign. Last September, we were canvassing at Mount Vernon City Fest on a nice Saturday afternoon. Hundreds of people from my city were enjoying the popup vendors, lively music, and the good vibes. As people walked down Gramatan Ave., I would engage with them about our campaign. Almost everyone was extremely warm and receptive, but one man became agitated when we spoke to him, raising his voice and cursing about the corrupt politicians that didn’t care about people in Mount Vernon. He told me how he had been formerly incarcerated and that, after his release, it had become impossible for him to get a job. He said frustratingly that he sometimes felt as if he had no other option but to go back to selling drugs to survive.

I listened to this man and felt his pain. It was a pain that was the product of systemic neglect: pipelines that gave him little chance to escape and less reason to believe in the fairness of the system. After speaking with him about mass incarceration and job guarantees, he ended up saying he’d look into our campaign and spread the word with his people. Whomever they vote for is not what’s important; what was so impactful was seeing him become willing to re-engage in a political process that has intentionally excluded him. Under 10% of people in District 16 turn out for elections because they don’t believe engaging in politics will affect their material reality, and, as a result, the ruling class is able to entrench the status quo. The man whom I was speaking to, in that moment, re-entered a movement that existed before and will exist after our campaign. We are happy to join him and Jamaal in the struggle for justice, locally and internationally.","I decided to run for Congress because I knew that our needs in District 16 weren't being met.

10102782297979344,"Ciham and Ousman share a tragic experience: they are Muslims of African descent who have been kept in inhuman detention for years. We must amplify their cases, especially since it’s #Ramadan.⁣
⁣
On Sunday, Ousman spent his 1,000th day in ICE detention. Despite a gubernatorial pardon, letters from Congress, #COVID19, & a parole request, #ICE refuses to release him.⁣
⁣
Ciham has spent over 8 years in incommunicado detention in #Eritrea. This is the sad plight for thousands of unjustly detained prisoners in Eritrea, but Ciham’s case is unique in that this teenager was born in Los Angeles; she is an American citizen. One Day Seyoum received some good news from Kamala Harris that she would give Ciham’s case the attention it deserves (thank you everyone who went #Purple4Ciham).⁣

Let’s keep resisting until we #FreeThemAll4PublicHealth","Ciham and Ousman share a tragic experience: they are Muslims of African descent who have been kept in inhuman detention for years. We must amplify their cases, especially since it’s #Ramadan.⁣
⁣
On Sunday, Ousman spent his 1,000th day in ICE detention. Despite a gubernatorial pardon, letters from Congress, #COVID19, & a parole request, #ICE refuses to release him.⁣
⁣
Ciham has spent over 8 years in incommunicado detention in #Eritrea. This is the sad plight for thousands of unjustly detained prisoners in Eritrea, but Ciham’s case is unique in that this teenager was born in Los Angeles; she is an American citizen. One Day Seyoum received some good news from Kamala Harris that she would give Ciham’s case the attention it deserves (thank you everyone who went #Purple4Ciham).⁣

10102729136520334,"I can't stand hearing the phrase ""return to normal."" Not only - whether April 12 or June 1st - is it ludicrously out-of-touch with reality, but we're talking about mass death right in front of us. There is no return, and nothing will ever be normal -\-\ not for the educators and nurses who have died, the teen who died after being denied care, all of the families affected, and everyone (especially us here in NY) watching this collective tragedy play out in isolation while trump prioritizes the economy over the health and safety of the people who make it function.

Speaking of a ""return to normal"" to a traumatized nation is not uplifting or comforting (transparency and truthfulness can help with anxiety). To those grieving, ""a return to normal"" is even worse: an inhumane disregard of loss, of life, of love.

I've been struck by, what seems to me is, a lack of collective mourning (or at least a failure to hold space for grief); in fact, many politicians have been trying to minimize what has been happening on the ground (and continue on with business as usual)...imagine if they did that after 9/11.

In the Eritrean and Ethiopian Orthodox tradition, there are prescribed lengths for mourning. Typically, after 40 days, the intense mourning period is deemed to be complete, and it is culturally acceptable for a family to begin adapting to their new reality. In the diaspora, with families dispersed by migritude and refugeedom, this can take on extreme measures. After my father died, my family had our traditional Eritrean mourning; however, because of work, flights, and availability, some relatives and family friends outside the US missed the funeral and the 40 day period.

We had some relatives come to our house to pay their respects 6-10 months after my father's death. We'd be at home, and, unexpectedly, someone would knock on our door. As we opened the door to see who it was, relatives would enter our home hysterically wailing and crying like my father had just died yesterday. Tbh it was sort of difficult for us as a family: dealing with the emotional rollercoaster of matching the somberness of late-arriving relatives from abroad who had missed the mourning period. The depths to which the culture required acknowledgement of other's loss would've been absurd if the solidarity weren't so necessary and oddly beautiful.

So much of American culture and politics precludes the possibility of solidarity, in life and in death. Instead of acknowledgement, there is erasure; instead of support, sacrifice. What does it look like for our country to survive this pandemic and put on late-arriving, Eritrean-mourning tears for those who have suffered and those who will? A respect that recognizes that ""normal"" is something we never can (nor should) return to.

10102690448970494,"What a day! We had 30 volunteers take over Gunhill this afternoon: knocking over 1000 doors, collecting signatures on train platforms, hitting up barber shops, and spreading the word on the street.⁣
⁣
To crush our targets was great, but it didn’t compare to seeing some of the Eri elders canvass with me. While their pitches are sometimes humorously unorthodox, it’s emotional to see them, as Eritreans, take part in a democratic process here in America that is denied to them in their homeland. They’re so good tho: my aunt collected 30 signatures in an hour, even going on a bus to get the bus driver’s, who claimed to have known me (I gotta review the petitions!)⁣
⁣
But even that means nothing when held to the 2nd photo. I taught at 113 (a couple blocks away) my first 3 years, but haven’t seen most of my students since they graduated/I left. We were so close—we had to be: it was about survival in such a system. I always wondered about how they were doing, worried a lot about some of them. ⁣
⁣
Simon was one student whom I never worried about. One of the funniest students I’ve ever taught, he never put other students down for a laugh or succumbed to peer pressure to maintain others’ perception of him. He was just a good kid. Of course, as we’re getting ready for the canvass, who do I see walking down White Plains but that good kid I haven’t seen since 2012. Simon had more facial hair and a little girl, but he was the same amazing person I taught during MS. We caught up about life (he’s now 23), fatherhood, the old class. He couldn’t believe I’m running for Congress. He’s never voted, so when my RFD asked if he wanted to register, Simon replied, “anything for you, Mr. G.” I told him I know he’s in a rush to see his baby girl; we’ll find time. As he said his goodbyes, Simon let me know, “you know you’re the only teacher I ever learned from.” For so many reasons, I wanted to cry.","What a day!

10102606012671514,"We learned about #MLK every year in school. Two weeks before a heavy dose of Oprah, Jackie Robinson, and Bill Cosby handouts, we were given watered-down worksheets of MLK. I always hated it. The rote savior-worshipping. The [what felt like to a child] incomplete, token Black history.

That being said, I at least always had an awareness of King, even if the history hadn’t been accurately presented. We were never taught about the Black women of the Movement. We were never exposed to the anti-colonial struggles King stood in solidarity with.

I remember when, as a teen, I first learned of #Lumumba, #AmilcarCabral, Biko, and Sankara. Before I could even appreciate their lives, I was thrust upon their deaths: Lumumba’s assassination 59 years ago Friday; Cabral’s 47 years ago today. Western assassination after assassination, imperialist violence over decades packaged into a couple of hours of reading for any young person who wanted to be overwhelmed by what their teachers never taught them. A blood-soaked trail on Encarta I followed.

I will always be angry tbh. Not because of the history itself, but because it was denied to me and continues to be denied to us. MLK didn’t stand alone...and he wasn’t killed alone either.

“I’m running for congress. I’m actually on the way right now to meet with some union representatives to ask for their endorsement. The whole experience has been a whirlwind. I’ve been working as a special education teacher for the past eight years, so all of this is new to me. Fundraising is definitely more soul-sucking than I expected it to be. I don’t have many millionaires in my network, so it involves making thousands of cold calls. Sometimes I can spend four hours on the phone without making a single connection. I’m running against an entrenched incumbent. And he’s been in power for over thirty years, so he collects $2800 checks without even asking. My only real chance is to expand the electorate. Only ten percent of the people in my district even voted during the last election. So I’ve been spending most of my time in lower income communities, and communities of color—speaking directly to them. These people are often excluded from the conversation because it’s assumed they don’t vote. But I’ll talk to anyone. About the military industrial complex. About climate change. About the school-to-prison pipeline. I just stand out on train platforms during rush hour, and if somebody makes eye contact, I’m going for it.""",Best random stop ever (thanks Bloomberg smh)!

It's really overwhelming. My father grew up in Hadish Adi. My mother came to this country without a cent to her name. Eritrea was born as an independent nation 8 years after I was. Our future was never written, but we have always been guided by love and purpose.

I can say proudly that I am the Mount Vernon product of people who loved sacrifice and the struggle; of illiterate women under 5 feet who had more wisdom than their bodies could hold; of revolutionaries without green cards who showed solidarity with people whom they couldn't communicate; of the most resilient students - in the Bronx, Uptown, and Ramallah - who despite the hard world around them, never shied from showing love.

He knows we must stop these endless wars! His deep connections to foreign policy and his commitment to nonviolence are just some of the reason I have been putting in the work to get him elected.” - Kat Brezler

In 2011 Eliot Engel voted against withdrawing US troops from Afghanistan. While the congress member was voting for wars @AndomForNY was marching against them. ‬

10102463698804644,"Five years ago today, my father passed away. Thinking back to that day is so unsettling not because it is centered around his death, for which I had then been preparing for about a year, but because it simultaneously feels like a lifetime ago, even though I remember the most specific of details as if it were yesterday.

I was teaching my last class before lunch, going over a writing prompt with Anjelei. In the middle of class, I received a call from my sister. Normally I wouldn't have picked up, but I felt it. She told me to come home immediately, and, when I asked her why, she said through tears ""just come."" I hugged my co-teacher in the classroom and briefly cried with our grade-level social worker out in the hallway.

That drive from the Heights to Mount Vernon was one of the longest drives of my life. I try and empathize with my family members who traveled from Cali, Canada, and Saudi Arabia to bury their brother, their thoughts whirling for hours thousands of feet in the air. Each red light, I held out hope that my premonition would be proven incorrect, but the feeling became more foreboding the closer I got to MV. The only other day similar to my 9/10/14 is 9/11/01, the second day of my junior year, one which I also remember intimately. I left school early and when I got home, I watched the towers fall for hours, on repeat. Each time, a small part of me hoped for a different ending, one in which they didn't crumble... but it never came.

When I got to my home on 9/10, I saw all the cars parked outside our house. I knew.

I didn't cry when I found out my father died, or at the funeral, or much there after in the immediacy. Again, I had been preparing for it for months after we found the treatments were ineffective. But a couple months later, I was sometimes left with an inconsolable loneliness at the realization in those instinctive moments when I would want to call my father with a question that there would be no answer, or that the void in the dinner table could only be filled by memories.

Death distorts time, a problematic function for Eritreans, who have largely existed outside of it (we are occupied when Africa is independent, and #1 most censored country when the world is democratic). For my family, there is no present with my father, but we can connect with him in the future by unearthing his past: through old photos I had previously never seen (like these here), his writings, and stories from friends/family. The only other engagement I can have is through dreams.

While rare now, dreams of my father were frequent in the months after his death. My father once appeared majestically to a hero's earthly welcome at a spruced-up version of the old Eritrean Community Center on 125th. Almost always though, he would pop up in my dreams sickly and emaciated, withered like the flowers we refused to throw away after the funeral. I became obsessed with these Stage 4 images, subconsciously, and couldn't shake them away: dreams that were supposed to give life, but ultimately didn't in the way we wanted. In that, I connected with my father's own dreams, his obsessions, and ultimate pain that contributed to his death. He dreamed of a liberated Eritrea and fought/sacrificed his whole life for it. His and Eritrea's victory were stalled, however, and that ephemeral euphoria transformed into years of bitterness and regret, stress that literally scavenged away at him as Eritrea became more and more dictatorial.

I have never posted on the anniversary of my father's death (just bdays), but five years feels crazy, as does 18 years of Eritrean dictatorship since G-15, 18 years since 9/11. I'm happy to say though that whenever I dream my father now he's never a dying cancer patient. They are dreams of life that get me out of bed in the exact opposite way his threats of throwing water on me used to do: revitalized by the love and support of a loved one I haven't heard from in a while. I hope his dreams give life too.","Five years ago today, my father passed away.

10102364014477834,"My family was never big on Father’s Day, so I was actually a bit surprised that my mom wanted us to go to the cemetery this morning.

I don’t feel any different on Father’s Day or feel anything when I see my dad’s tombstone. They’re symbols, so naturally they’re important to some, but empty for others. For that reason, I don’t really mind going to the cemetery. I adapted to the reality of living in a world without my father shortly after his passing, so it’s usually about supporting my mother and my family members.

I guess I hadn’t been to the cemetery in some time, but the area where my father was buried wasn’t how I remembered it. My father’s tombstone used to sit in the middle of the last row, but every time I come back there are more and more rows. More tombstones, more American flags and more Puerto Rican flags, more new flowers hiding the wilted ones, more half-filled bottles of Hennessy.

I walk by the tombstones and always check the dates. For some time during my father’s illness and immediately after he died, I felt jealous, cheated; he had so much more life to live. I think back to that pain as I see all of the young people. 14 years old. 6. 1985, same year I was born. The most difficult tombstones to look at are the ones that have a portrait. Their smile, their eyes, you inevitably wonder their story. What were their hopes? Their fears?

My father’s tombstone does not have a portrait. I’m not sure if it’s because we were simple or cheap, maybe both. I see my mother’s tears but don’t feel our loss here.

I miss my father most when I involuntarily think to go to him - that he’d be able to answer a question I have about Eritrea or that he’d appreciate a story I read or joke I heard. There’s a loneliness that lingers knowing that that connection is severed forever.

I wish he were here with me on this next journey. To help. To support. To live. While he’s no longer physically here, I have found ways for him to live within me. Looking through old photos or talking to older Eritreans who knew him always unlocks some part of his past that I never knew. It gives him life and enriches me in a way that I thought was no longer possible. As I now try this very crazy thing, I can’t wait to learn more about my father’s history fighting the system, challenging Isaias in ’77, or protesting apartheid. So I add on to my father’s story, and I hope that’ll embolden me to keep contributing to mine. #HappyFathersDay","My family was never big on Father’s Day, so I was actually a bit surprised that my mom wanted us to go to the cemetery this morning.

10102316020847454,"A motorist was stopped in Pelham Manor and the Manor Police Department notified ICE that he was undocumented. ICE arrive in the Pelham courthouse in an attempt to detain him. The man chose not to accept bail so that he would go to jail rather than be detained by ICE. He is going to be BACK in the courthouse this evening where ICE will likely be there to once again try and detain him if he is released. This man has a family he is trying to support and was driving without a license because NY State will not issue him to him because he is undocumented. He is trying to support his two children, one of whom is autistic.

Please join Progressive Women of Pelham in supporting this man at the courthouse tonight. State Senator Alessandra Biaggi will be there, along with some other elected officials. There will be press there, including Univision. The legality of ICE entering the courtroom is contentious, but currently allowable. The constable, however, does not have to comply with ICE or just hand him over to them. Please come at 5:30pm with signs for the press and to support his family, and If you can, stay later in the hopes of forming a human shield when he exits to get him into a car (private property). We anticipate it will be easier to legally shield him from ICE if there a LOT of us there. Signs should say ""No ICE in Pelham"" or ""No ICE in NY"" or ""Driver's Licenses for ALL"" or ""Drive Only Licenses in NY.""

10102297095344314,"Crazy to think it was 15 years ago, freshman year, that I made the switch from Yalestation Dating to Facebook. The number 15 stands out though because, at the age of 15, Eritrean-American Ciham Ali was unjustly imprisoned for trying to flee #Eritrea. I look quickly at these photos that popped up, 15 years worth of memories, from college to teaching, as well as trips, weddings, and family, and wonder what memories Ciham holds on to as she languishes in prison. I lament a childhood lost and think what memories Ciham could've made these past 7 years if she were free, as she and thousands of other Eritreans illegally detained should be.

It has been wonderful these last couple of days to see thousands of habesha and non-habesha celebrate the life of #NipseyHussle. As Nipsey struggled for the collective betterment of his community, let’s continue to mobilize; let’s continue to celebrate life; let’s wish #HappyBirthdayCiham as she now turns 22 in prison.

Rep. Karen Bass wants to enter Nipsey Hussle’s contributions to LA into the congressional record. She, along with Ilhan Omar and Joe Neguse, also recently returned from a congressional trip to Eritrea. Let’s pressure her to keep up the good work she’s doing. Ciham was born in LA!! We need to pressure the US government to fight for one of its own citizens and on the Eritrean regime to release her.

Please call Rep. Karen Bass' DC office: 202-225-7084. She is the Chair of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa.

10101689735084144,"For the third year, my father was not here to celebrate his birthday with his bday twin, his wife, my mother. On previous July 7's since his death, I'd been pretty motivated to reflect on his life, my parents' marriage, and the various activities - from the baller to the boring - that they engaged in.

This year, however, I just wasn't feeling it; I just wanted to drive my mom to the birthday massage we booked for her, and, if she wanted to eat lunch, be a good Eritrean child and sit with her for 2 hours as our family talked crap about Trump and took part in perfunctorily, wholesome Habesha gossip. To my surprise, when I told her at lunch I didn't want to write anything about dad this year, this woman who hadn't been part of an online community since AOL 4.0 strongly urged me to post something to social media.

In going through old photos, these two stuck out. The feelings evoked when looking at these moments in time resonate with the symbols of what my father's birthday has now become: life, hope, and death. While the arrangement of this permutation changes depending on mood, I am made ever more aware, since my father's passing, that even in the celebration of life and hope for the future that are birthdays, that a death has always been present.

Photo 1 - Father and Son Reunited After 16 Years - New York, 1986. I imagine my father at peace, lying with my grandfather on a field that could be in Eritrea. The hope of an immigrant that must come by having the comfort of his father by his side. In missing that feeling these last three years, I struggle to fathom how my father, and millions other like him, could eschew his family and homeland for so long. I hope in this moment my father felt like he was back in his home, with the past lives of those killed and erased by his immigrant mind for sanity and survival revived in his heart. I felt that love in visiting my father's side back in Eritrea, where, even forty-seven years after leaving (with only two brief returns in between), he was never forgotten.

Photo 2 - Eritrean Independence Gala with Future ""President"" Isaias Afwerki at the United Nations - 1993. White teeth, even without toothbrushes, show the hope for the future, the smile of a life fulfilled and a struggle over. In this photo, no one is thinking about the dreams that had to die so that the liberation dream could be achieved. What became of those smiles then as independence's iron fist waved hello? Did you guys look at this photo from liberation to dictatorship and think what could have been? I don't know how you all lived with the revolutionary regret of a dream turned nightmare. The strength you had to adapt to the postcolonial pain of a future dead, like the immigrant's past, made quotidian. I understand that pain somewhat in your passing, and I'm ever more thankful for your example, your sacrifice, and, for our life and our hope, your perseverance.

Did you guys look at this photo from liberation to dictatorship and think what could have been? I don't know how you all lived with the revolutionary regret of a dream turned nightmare. The strength you had to adapt to the postcolonial pain of a future dead, like the immigrant's past, made quotidian. I understand that pain somewhat in your passing, and I'm ever more thankful for your example, your sacrifice, and, for our life and our hope, your perseverance.

My father did refer to himself and the friends of his youth as ""ghetto boys,"" but I always figured he was being hyperbolic or trying to be funny in an immigrant, non-funny way. Hadish Adi was always my favorite neighborhood because the community was so rich, and, as an 8 year old, nowhere else could I have had so much freedom to play all day without parental supervision.

Amongst my family, in my father's native land, I feel his presence, and it makes me just want to throw a rock at a baboon, out of love, of course.

10101235471157694,"I never saw my parents kiss...at least, I don't think I did. I also don't remember them saying ""I love you"" to each other but that surely had to have happened at some point. These moments, lost in history and/or marriage, or lack of them, may have abated my juvenile confidence in my parents' union, but I always could trust that their births, divinely coincidental, July 7, 1949, were harbingers of lives to be shared (plus they were old-school Africans...""love you"" is so neo-colonial).

The day of my parents' birth, July 7, not the date of my father's death, is in many ways the most surreal day of the year for my family. For the second year, there's less cake, fewer wishes, and different jokes with a bit more muted laughs as we're all forced to acknowledge the absence in our lives.

I wonder how the birthday party would have played differently. We still would've watched Germany- France, but after that what would we have discussed: refugees, ISIS, police shootings (all subjects intimately affecting Eritreans around the world). Inevitably, it would have led to stories, maybe about ghetto kids from Asmara battling baboons and Italians, maybe about righteous violence and its limits, maybe about our experiences navigating race and identity in America.

I loved when my mom and dad would recount finding me in the bathtub at the age of 3, pouring milk over my body. Today, I would've ask, ""What the hell were you thinking, Dad?! Your oldest child literally whitewashing himself!"" The answer's absent, so I'm left to imagine his response, his response to the world, his dreams, his fears.

As I was being unconsciously socialized to think of myself as less than, my father showed me what love is through consistent sacrifice for the movement, his people, and his family. And I think how his actions and those of thousands other Eritreans are instructive in these times. How willing were they to think outside the box, to approach life in ways they had never previously, leaving their villages and homelands never to return? Leaving their careers for the cause? How, in times of life and death, when mistakes were made, he made it a point to be open and transparent because it was the just thing to do! Naturally with such a fervent belief in justice and equality, my parents should share a birthday.

One night, about a year after my father's death, I asked an uncle, a former soldier, if he regretted his efforts with the independence movement. After contemplating for a couple of seconds with a seeming look of chagrin, he pined, ""I love the struggle; the struggle sustains me."" I always thought it was the same for my father, but his ""struggle"" was love.

Nothing can be bigger and better though, as I know there can be no other profession as fulfilling as that of a teacher: that culminating moment at the end of a days-long struggle when a student finally masters an academic objective; hearing your kids articulate progressive ideals and deconstruct social hierarchies with the knowledge that it’s partly a manifestation of the classroom culture you created; when your students behave like upstanders despite social pressures; the ever-lasting bonds created with colleagues and students alike; the fact that this is one of the few jobs in which meticulously planning does not guarantee “success;” and the positive energy you receive when you see your kids in the morning.

It was sad hearing my soon-to-be graduating students tell me to stay “one more year.” I asked them what it mattered to them since they would no longer be at TEP, and they replied, “but we want to come back and visit you.” Hopefully, despite no longer having a physical teaching presence, some of the lessons, speeches, turn-ups, and death stares still resonate in my students’ minds…just like their discoveries, accomplishments, jokes, and absurd statements stay with me. I’m going to miss saying “personal space” when students unsuccessful try to hug me (“Mr. G, do you say personal space to your girlfriend?” lol smh). Who can I say “fix your face” to now? “Stop playing yourself?!” Conversations devoid of any discussion around hairlines (50% of all middle school boy conversation) is surely a poignant existence. After 7 years though, I’m ready and excited to make some new lines [insert annoying teacher elbow nudge for intentional corniness].

10101108923784644,"I ""love freedom"" as much as the next guy, but the construction of independence mythologies post-liberation has a troubling history, certainly in the Eritrean context but especially in Haiti-DR, two countries whose independence and post-colonial stories are both amazing…and crazy.

Today, DR celebrates its independence day, but the celebration is not for liberation from Spain – the colonial masters who exterminated the indigenous population, instituted slavery, abused the land, and who later returned to recolonize the country – but Haiti, the country which ended colonialism and abolished slavery in present-day DR. What is DR celebrating: nascent nationalism or independence from blackness?

Former President Juan Bosch has noted that the majority of the Dominican population (65% of the country then were free or enslaved blacks) welcomed Haitian liberation and even occupation b/c it meant emancipation and the end of a racist, colonial system. Celebrating independence from Haiti erases this memory and contributes to a xenophobic, anti-Haitianismo narrative infamously propagated by Trujillo. This narrative belies the revolutionary truth of a common people on a shared island fighting against slavery, white supremacy, and (neo)colonial, capitalist exploitation, one which all progressive and African peoples owe thanks.
