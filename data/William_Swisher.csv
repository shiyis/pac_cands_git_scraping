We are fighting for Women's equality on the front lines and these old (mostly) white men who run this country are trying to legislate a woman's body. #keepyourlawsoffmybody We can and must fight

I understand backing a man over an incumbent Democratic woman would be shocking to some but Bustos is hosting fundraisers for anti-abortion Democrats like Dan Lipinski.

92,2019-05-17 20:24:54+00:00,1129482950880518144,@Statistar30 @bernieshq I thought drug companies only change their formularies at the beginning of each year.  This is genuinely messed up.  We need to make at least that much of a promise to people that drug co.'s cannot take a med off their covered formulary without 90 days notice and informing ppl.

My campaign is 100% grassroots which means any funding I get must come from you.  https://t.co/gOVRM2sDWH Let's elect a true progressive.
