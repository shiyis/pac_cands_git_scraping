Use your time and research talent to make sure the voters around you are knowledgeable and ready"

THAT is NO KIND of strategy.  That is passivity 101A.

If we build permanent county-based voter contact &amp; engagement, we will need to spend a FRACTION of what we spend now, motivating people to vote for the policy that makes life better for all of us"

Remember, the GOP has Fox News as it‚Äôs permanent messaging wing, and very well organized local parties that fund voter contact ALL YEAR! 

THAT is why our messaging misses the mark"
