89,2022-01-04 22:02:33+00:00,1478487037246324738,"@Section_230 I agree on 1st Amendment, however, 230 is overly broad and subjective.

We are past that point, and reasonable moderation protections can remain while striking ‚Äúotherwise objectionable‚Äù."

I completely agree with you, but the Congress has already created artificial conditions in the marketplace with the Section 230 protections that are being weaponized for viewpoint suppression. Thank you!"
