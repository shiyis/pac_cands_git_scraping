86,2022-04-23 13:26:23+00:00,1517857417459118081,@mpukita Not belittling you.  And Bless you for spending your own money.  I will have spent FIVE MILLION of my own money to remove DeWine.  But the question is what have you gotten accomplished.  I guess we will all see on May 3rd.  I wish you well.
87,2022-04-23 13:21:53+00:00,1517856286347603968,"@NicoleMccune4 @mpukita I guess you can go talk to the property owner.  It would be easy for the other campaign to go ask him now.  If they were smart they would.  Then the individuals could be prosecuted under the law.  If it was the reverse and we had permission, we would."

I actually like your message.  You took sides with the other Governor's campaign early.  Your opinion of me cannot be trusted.

The owner of the property does not support Blystone and did not approve the sign location on his property.  The owner asked that the sign be removed and replaced with a Renacci sign. The sign was returned to the Blystone team.
