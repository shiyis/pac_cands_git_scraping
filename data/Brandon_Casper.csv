90,2022-01-30 18:27:46+00:00,1487855068619558912,@realuncledenden @CC_Utah I have a different hope for America‚Äôs future than you do. I hope for politicians who don‚Äôt endlessly fight together. That leads nowhere but more fighting. I hope for politicians who work together to find solutions without compromising their values. That‚Äôs the politician I will be
91,2022-01-30 18:25:39+00:00,1487854537562013698,"@realuncledenden @CC_Utah I do see what‚Äôs going on. You‚Äôre misunderstanding me, but I don‚Äôt think you intend to understand. 
I won‚Äôt bend or give in to Democrat ideas. As I said before, I will strongly defend conservative values."
92,2022-01-30 18:07:17+00:00,1487849917020180482,"@realuncledenden @CC_Utah My goal is to progress politics, and just because I‚Äôm unwilling to treat others down doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm not a Conservative."
93,2022-01-30 18:06:01+00:00,1487849595958820866,"@realuncledenden @CC_Utah That‚Äôs unfortunate. I‚Äôve been a Republican all my life, unlike the incumbent John Curtis. I didn‚Äôt say I support democrat ideas. I‚Äôm saying there are solutions we haven‚Äôt looked at because people are more loyal to their party than they are to their values."
94,2022-01-30 17:33:42+00:00,1487841463694028802,"@realuncledenden @CC_Utah In my case, it means I‚Äôm not extreme, I‚Äôm not far right. 
I‚Äôm a conservative who will work to preserve conservative values. I‚Äôm also planning to work to find solutions to issues that both democrats and republicans can agree on."
