It's vital to come together and vote in November to keep the Democratic majority to protect women's rights and fight for access to healthcare for all Americans.

Unlike my opponent, who receives millions from corporations, I am funded by everyday working-class people. We are relying on grassroots donors like you!

Shapiro, a republican candidate for #NJ04, submitted his line as, “Let’s Go Brand*n – FJB”. Profanity directed at the President of the United States is disrespectful to the office."

#NJ03 needs a Congressman who supports Medicare for All and acknowledges inflation. Congress must help Americans afford the costs of essential goods.
