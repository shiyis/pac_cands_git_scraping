If I am elected, expect my support in repealing the law that criminalizes a woman's right to choose. This is absolutely absurd that in 2022 we are here having to say this."

The Democratic Party needs to step up right now and protect women's rights. This is truly dangerous and why precedent matters. @MIHouseDems @MISenDems @GovWhitmer
