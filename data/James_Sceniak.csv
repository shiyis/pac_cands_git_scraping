85,2022-06-22 17:19:46+00:00,1539659422481256448,@INDprogressives I'm not sure you've read the SC judgement or others identical to it 7-2 votes in the past. It's about being equitable. If one person gets school choice dollars everyone gets school choice dollars. But nice job trying to fear monger your constituents.

Cutting taxes (government income) by themselves without reducing spending will contribute to inflation. Taxes need cut, Americans need relief.

Obviously the bigger takeaway is that *IF* the government is going to fund education it should be up to the parents how that money is spent.

For example eliminating cost plus contracts, restructuring current contracts, eliminating wasteful spending, elimination of wants programs for needs programs.
