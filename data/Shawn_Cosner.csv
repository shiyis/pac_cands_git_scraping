1,2021-11-25 12:37:45+00:00,1463849386509803520,@BBCJonSopel These are strange times indeed. The worst of humanity has shown itself as the rule not the exception once again. But what follows is growth and a commitment to protect the peace for a few generations. Our People will fight for decency.I enjoyed your piece and wish you the best.

It's not an issue of hardball but the likelyhood his replacement will be a Republican decreasing the odds of any compromise. Manchin is neutral.
