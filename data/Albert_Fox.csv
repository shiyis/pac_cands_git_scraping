The only industrialized country in the world that burdens our young students with debt. As US Senator I will work every day to bring sanity to the issue!

Florida deserves a US Senate Dem Nominee who actually knows the subject matter, can defeat Rubio, and take that to the US Senate.

You’re all talking points Val."
