1,2022-04-15 03:46:29+00:00,1514812379892133888,@SceneSallard I'd love to do an interview about the upcoming Ohio 11th congressional primaries. You might be intrigued by what I have to say.

I  fought back fortunately I was able to overturn it and now a candidate for US Congress. Ironically my opponent for the Republican nomination is a registered democrat smh

4,2022-02-11 11:23:20+00:00,1492096913247768582,I took the time to complete @Ballotpedia's candidate survey to share my vision and goals. You'll be able to see the responses on my profile shortly.

8,2022-01-14 10:52:49+00:00,1481942372644708358,Has anyone looked at these so called civil rights bills?
9,2021-12-30 13:18:36+00:00,1476543244255346692,@Crab_Barrell @kimKBaltimore Please explain to me why the real frontline healthcare workers should lose theirs?
10,2021-12-22 07:49:04+00:00,1473561209882484745,@kimKBaltimore @SamGreeni  She is only pointing out the truth. 1+1=2 Smoke and mirrors from the democrats cannot continue to rule. Things will never change.
11,2021-12-22 07:42:25+00:00,1473559535046610944,@kimKBaltimore Check Cleveland on that list as well. We need to arm the constituents with the power of knowledge. It makes no sense to continue to elect ppl who look like a reflection of the community but blame those who are not in power.
