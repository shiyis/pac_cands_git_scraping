89,2022-06-17 20:03:48+00:00,1537888761911971845,@ChronicHope_DC @AvidaLectrix You‚Äôre saying a woman has no agency here.  You‚Äôre saying a woman has no right to prevent her own death during pregnancy.  Abortion is not murder. Leaving a woman unable to protect herself from avoidable death sounds more like that.
90,2022-06-17 19:46:09+00:00,1537884323877007363,"@cynic_idealist I‚Äôm certainly not doing that. Criminalization if abortion certainly would do that, though."

92,2022-06-17 19:30:20+00:00,1537880343138537479,"@ChronicHope_DC Science absolutely does not agree with you.  But let‚Äôs extend your argument out logically.  You‚Äôre using a ‚Äúpotential for life = life‚Äù argument.  If you extend that logic far, it falls apart."
93,2022-06-17 19:26:29+00:00,1537879371452624898,@broodwars64 I‚Äôve also replied to that question in another reply to the original thread.
94,2022-06-17 19:22:13+00:00,1537878300214890497,@broodwars64 I‚Äôve already done so on other replies to the original post.

96,2022-06-17 19:20:06+00:00,1537877767143837701,"@broodwars64 I don‚Äôt really think this merits a response, other than my ask for you to do some research as to the consequences abortion bans have on all women, including those that don‚Äôt pursue abortion."
97,2022-06-17 19:07:56+00:00,1537874702768693252,@Mattmanver2 Abortion isn‚Äôt murder.  I‚Äôve already replied to this though on another reply to this thread.
98,2022-06-17 18:51:20+00:00,1537870527875932166,"@Alejbkr @jmwiebke I‚Äôm going to control what I can and do the right things for the right reasons.  If I win, great.  If I don‚Äôt, I‚Äôll be at peace, and I‚Äôll keep fighting the good fight regardless."
