We, the military, took out an enemy combatant on the battlefield. If you wanted him protected you should have removed him from the terrorist list. You failed to do your job Senator!!"

The second you get yourself in the middle of partisan politics you have failed as a military officer. The LTC was justifiably removed. Had I been his supervisor I would have removed him immediately!!

You never give your opponent the last move. The House should have admonished and closed the case. #ImpeachmentTrials
