0,2022-06-13 22:14:23+00:00,1536472074134298624,@jtwilcox111 This is despicable.  Glad that their efforts failed thanks to masonry floors. Let us know when the perpetrators are arrested.
1,2022-05-28 17:29:49+00:00,1530602256843673601,@Jim_Brunner @GovInslee @seattletimes @JacksonMaynard8 @BIAW2 @AGCofWashington thank you for fighting this end run around the legislature and industry stakeholders.

5,2022-05-08 00:33:03+00:00,1523098620836204544,@stevemgordon67 Remember when Democrats called Republican grassroots efforts “astroturf?”  Isn’t that what Nick Hanauer is doing when he gives over $600K (x2 for the other family member who matched his donation) to an anti gun initiative traen encourages harassment to raise the cost for others?

13,2022-03-07 17:50:16+00:00,1500891594852995072,@Whoanow8 @hitEsc @AGOWA There are many good reasons for law abiding people to have firearms.  Self defense is a primary one.  A standard capacity magazine for most firearms is more than the 10 rounds in this legislation.  This makes it easier for criminals to attack a less prepared victim.
14,2022-03-01 23:35:07+00:00,1498804054981427203,@AGOWA It’s very telling that SB 5407 - which would have punished criminals using a stolen weapon- was killed in committee but the ban of standard capacity magazines advanced.  They don’t want to stop crime.  They only want to make things difficult for the law abiding.
