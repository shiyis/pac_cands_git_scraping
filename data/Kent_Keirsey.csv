Most regulatory barriers to entry are sold as ways to protect consumers, but are really crafted by lobbyists and protect industry incumbents.  This is why deregulation is hard and thankless, but important."

If prices are too high then others will enter the market and prices should come down.  If not, price caps will hurt supply.  If barriers, they're likely regulatory. This is where deregulation may help"

To stop inflation he wants to shrink the economy, spend more, raise taxes, set price caps, and drain oil reserves. Do the opposite! Spend less, lower taxes, and deregulate.
