1,2021-10-08 13:06:45+00:00,1446462067637108739,RT @ASDNboy: @POTUS 2001 US was 8 billion in Debt. Fast forward 20 years later and its 30 trillion. Did the general public see any of this…
2,2021-10-08 12:51:09+00:00,1446458141302984719,@JacksonLeeTX18 Concerned about Climate Change because of energy independence? America has more and better environmental restrictions than the countries we are purchasing oil from. We are purchasing the same amount of oil from them with less environmental regulation on production.

Should have kept oil production and energy independence in America. That was a better plan which stimulated our economy and drove down costs across the board.

Nothing you have done has improved Americans lives. You’ve held your constituents back for years. It’s time to change that."

Neither of the 3 of you have worked for the people, only against them to push your agenda. I’ll be running for TX18 in 2022 to change that. America was built for the people. Better their lives, stop holding Americans back"

That’s why the Republicans are trying to tell you the truth about Jan 6th, COVID, what’s really going on and point out all the lies. Dems have bought and paid for most news sources to lie to you."
7,2021-09-29 03:39:48+00:00,1443057900134469633,@AustinHodyniak @POTUS You’re free to have your own opinion as well. That’s what America is about. I’m not going to be mad about your opinion or call you out for your opinion. We can discuss things if you’d like though so we understand each others side.

10,2021-09-29 03:15:10+00:00,1443051697803350017,@black0_panther @POTUS There was a better way to accomplish the same goal like using Bagram Air Base for starters. It has nothing to do with being Democrat or Republican. It’s just the fact that more troops didn’t have to die and Americans and our Allies didn’t have to be left behind.
11,2021-09-29 03:05:17+00:00,1443049211562430469,"@JacksonLeeTX18 Our border here in Texas is being invaded by illegal immigrants, drug traffickers and human traffickers but you have yet to care. That’s one reason why I’m coming after your seat in 2022 because you don’t care about Texans or the people. It’s time to get someone who does."
12,2021-09-29 03:02:16+00:00,1443048453291053057,@JacksonLeeTX18 The neglect and broken promises come from the Democratic Party. Why would anyone support a democratic bill? Eyes are opening to reality and the curtain is being pulled back. The Infrastructure bill attacks small business and gives more to foreign countries.

Biden decided to leave Bagram Air Base which had 3 runways and the most defensible. Biden left thousands of Americans behind enemy lines. Facts. Truth hurts…
14,2021-09-21 11:52:06+00:00,1440282685398605831,"@black0_panther @POTUS The Taliban didn’t take over the country and kill our troops last year even after troops were removed. They didn’t take over Afghanistan until this year. Biden botched the withdrawal. That is the problem. He picked the most indefensible airport to start, Facts."
15,2021-09-21 11:44:26+00:00,1440280756115308548,@dildilkiya @POTUS Yes it was started by a Rep President in response to 9/11. Wouldn’t you have done something also? Yes a Rep President made a deal with them that saved our troops lives. Biden got 13 troops killed with his botched plan and left them Billions in equipment. Could have done better.
16,2021-09-21 11:41:02+00:00,1440279904076009477,@Vicci1227 @POTUS How is that twisted? Do you not know what he did in Afghanistan? He gave them Billions in military equipment and pallets of Cash but wants to crack down on the American people because they don’t want to be forced to do something?

He’s not running the show as he was elected to do and doesn’t care about the American people. He just cares about the far left Democrats radical agenda.
20,2021-09-10 12:34:02+00:00,1436306973000151058,@JacksonLeeTX18 I agree ALL Legal American Citizens should have access and the right to vote. America was built on the States rights to govern their own state. I do not agree with the Federal Government controlling the states laws because that’s not a democratic republic which America is.
21,2021-09-10 12:24:57+00:00,1436304687389675522,"@JacksonLeeTX18 You can “stand” with whoever you want. But you’re not there actually standing with them, you’re just typing words, so stop the rhetoric. The Taliban don’t care and that should have been known and our weak @POTUS shouldn’t have given them Afghanistan."
22,2021-09-10 12:19:15+00:00,1436303253482975244,@JacksonLeeTX18 1. There is no test to determine the Delta variant vs COVID itself.  2. The Vaccine can’t be required by any company or office other than the state.  3. What happened to all the Democrats yelling “my body my choice”? Doesn’t fit your narrative for this one?
23,2021-09-10 12:12:59+00:00,1436301675036385286,@JacksonLeeTX18 So we are concerned with pushing how abortion should be legal vs educating young women on preventing pregnancy if they don’t want a child? Did you know about 95% of abortions are because of Social/Economic or just because reasons? Is that fair to the child or father?
24,2021-09-10 12:04:02+00:00,1436299425870237697,@WhiteHouse @VP 4 Million jobs haven’t been “Created” as stated. They were jobs that were already here which were shut down because of a virus. Did you think about unemployment claims being down because the benefit ran out for most?

The hotel should have let them stay for free and helped sign them up for FEMA"
