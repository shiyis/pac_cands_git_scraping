It's been 40, maybe even 50 years of fear mongering policy by Republican leaders that got us to this point."

So they won't do anything to give power to the Fed. We must elect Dems like me to get Voting Rights passed and prove good things can be done. https://t.co/ZAiE05vOy1

It still describes how to give an abortion. Period. Shut your yapping. Which means even in the Bible there were reasons to have an abortion. This is what happens when you use a text riddled with contradictions to anchor your reasoning.
