A gov. created, economic crisis. Let's help those that need it, &amp; let's work towards making ppl more self reliable long term. #GA14 https://t.co/lYmtlJu23f"

I wouldn't take my children to drag shows, but I most CERTAINLY wouldn't be trying to push a law to take away a parents right to decide that for their family. THIS IS MORE GOV. INVOLVEMENT! WE NEED LESS! #GA14 https://t.co/DObzQsXDIY"

What makes you think it is the right of the gov. to tell parents how to parent?? I thought you were big on parental rights, especially against CRT being pushed on them in school?"

Imagine what they could do with the extra money and no fear of having to pay it all back in lump sums."
