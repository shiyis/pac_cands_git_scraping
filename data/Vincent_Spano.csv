Our point of contention was not whether it exists (for now), but the extent to which freedom loving Americans will permit their rights to be eroded by those who do not think it should exists."
88,2018-07-29 08:57:43+00:00,1023492758978191362,"@HvinAMorganMomt No, the initial conversation was about my unashamed support of the 2nd A.  You responded by saying I was acting like the 2nd A is under attack, which it surely is.  You then asserted there‚Äôs nothing lawmakers can do to threaten it, and I called BS.  They certainly can."
