This is yet another reason we need to flip seats in our legislature. #mtpol https://t.co/jQO3ActmyW"

99,2022-01-16 15:29:43+00:00,1482736834656436230,@RcRegalstarfire Thanks for the question! I support what the scientists say regarding hunting in a given park. There are so many factors when it comes to wildlife management that I don't think there can be one broad policy. Ex.hunting is a key tool to prevent Chronic Wasting Disease spread.
