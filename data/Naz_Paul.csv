A small few qualify for the few options like asylum, LIFE act (if they have higher education), or if they have an immediate relative that’s a citizen. But the others just have to either get married to a citizen or go back and apply"

95,2022-06-09 21:24:08+00:00,1535009877256376320,@WayneWaller19 Out of curiosity did you help them with a work visa of some sort? Are you an employer? Thanks for engaging btw 👍
96,2022-06-09 21:22:24+00:00,1535009439672983553,@WayneWaller19 Well that’s very nice of you. If they qualified for asylum or had an immediate relative that was a citizen or had a higher education and could apply for the LIFE Act that would have worked but there are millions of people here that don’t have those options.

I’m for securing our border immediately but we have to fix the problem that has been enabled for 30 years plus. Real solutions. Saying to send the millions of people back is not going to fly and is unproductive speech."

99,2022-06-09 20:27:06+00:00,1534995526029979648,@SickofGOPswamp Yes gas prices are definitely a huge problem. My tweet was specific to immigration but we have many real issues that need solutions. I unfortunately heard a rumor we may hit $10/gal.
