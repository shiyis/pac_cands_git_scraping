678372925616157,"For all who voted Andrew Hunt and what we stood for, Thanks.

For the very few who put out effort to spread the Liberty message, you are the people who can really make a difference. Do not stop now but continue to work ideas gently into conversations and help wake up the People. I hope more of you become active as reaching out is required for such changes to become reality. Just talking among like minded people does very little.

We did achieve some improvements to government. Gov. Deal moved over from being a common core person in March to going all the way to school choice months into the campaign and looking at fully revamping education! I am hopeful that there will be some movement to adopt other parts of our platform as it was all designed to truly improvement government and our lives.

We learned some things from interactions, comments, and the high turnout by republicans and low democratic turnout; this election was controlled by fear voting of ending democratic power. The low total we achieved and the low overall voter turnout shows that the majority of people, who say they are dissatisfied with government, are not so dissatisfied with it enough to work a little bit to learn their options and actually go and vote. It is a sad that the American public is so heavily influenced by propaganda advertising filled with, at best, partial truths.

I really enjoyed my interactions with the 30,000+ very diverse people I met and all those I got to know. It is a rare but expanding personal experience of being a public figure and interacting with media. Now I go back to my personal life and more time with my wonderful family. I wish all of you the very best and God's blessings.","For all who voted Andrew Hunt and what we stood for, Thanks.

Dr. Hunt asks ""Mr. Deal. Sadly a bottom 10 list;
1. Highest unemployment
2. High poverty
3. Poor education
4. Expensive health care
5. 9th highest income tax rate (promised a cut)
6. The most corrupt state
7. High incarceration rates
8. $1500 loss to middle class family during your term
9. Terrible Atlanta traffic
10. You promised limited government but tax revenues increased by over 2 billion dollars.
You beautifully gloss over this, but can you acknowledge these facts?""

http://onlineathens.com/breaking-news/2014-10-19/deal-carter-hunt-clash-tv-debate","‘Deal, Carter, Hunt Clash in Debate’, by Walter Jones (link below)
Dr. Hunt asks ""Mr. Deal. Sadly a bottom 10 list;
1. Highest unemployment
2. High poverty
3. Poor education
4. Expensive health care
5. 9th highest income tax rate (promised a cut)
6. The most corrupt state
7. High incarceration rates
8. $1500 loss to middle class family during your term
9. Terrible Atlanta traffic
10. You promised limited government but tax revenues increased by over 2 billion dollars.
You beautifully gloss over this, but can you acknowledge these facts?""
Deal replied, “I reject your facts. I think they’re factually incorrect.”

• This survey includes ALL voters and does not exclude large groups like many media polls.
• Gainesville is where Deal is from - his numbers will likely be lower in other regions.
• Results are despite limited media coverage. We are by far the most cost effective campaign - an indicator of how we will run cost effective government.
• With Carter so low it proves that I am pulling from both parties.
• Including all voters shows we will do much better than the 4-7% other polls are showing. Just like Brat beat Cantor even though down 33% in final polls!

David Pennington

Republicans are Georgia's Problem

Left vs. Right
Recently, a friend lamented that the liberal left is destroying America, but I disagreed. The left is consistent and transparent in its belief that big government, higher taxes, and more regulation serve the greater good. The right espouses a limited government platform of lower taxes, less spending, and less regulation, which frees capital resulting in innovation and job creation. But do Georgia Republicans practice what they preach?

The Reality
Georgia's fiscal year 2014 results illustrate the reality vs. the rhetoric. Our revenue jumped $879 million over fiscal year 2013; but $473 million of this increase resulted from the new way cars are taxed. Elimination of the so-called birthday tax made headlines, but Governor Deal never touted the reality of his new ad valorem vehicle tax, Georgia's 2nd largest tax increase in twenty years. Why? He needed more tax revenue to support the $3.5 billion spending increase he has approved since taking office in 2011.

Responsibility for the largest tax increase in the last two decades also resides with Republicans. In 2009, Governor Sonny Perdue and the Republican controlled legislature repealed the Homeowner's Tax Relief Grant. This decision impacted middle and low income Georgia homeowners disproportionally.

After twelve years of Republican rule, Georgians' taxes are higher and state spending is higher.

The Fallout
Georgia was on a roll. From cracking the top twenty in many economic indicators, we have nosedived to the bottom ten if not the bottom five. Due to low paying jobs, only Mississippi has lower average premiums on the 'Obamacare' exchange than Georgia, and only Mississippi has a higher percentage of uninsured people; and, except for Mississippi, Georgia has the highest unemployment rate in the country at 7.8%.

Georgia's growing population is getting poorer. Other Republican led states are outperforming us because they have embraced real tax reform based on lowering state income tax, the most onerous tax for small businesses, our primary job creators. Meanwhile, Georgia's pseudo Republican leadership has no plans to reduce our income tax, the 9th highest in the country.

My Perspective
In the last twelve years, Georgia's Republican leadership has presided over what is arguably the largest economic decline, relative to the rest of the country, since the Civil War. This decline can be reversed if true limited government Republicans have the courage to enact bold policy changes. But the clock is ticking.

Republicans are Georgia's Problem

Left vs. Right
Recently, a friend lamented that the liberal left is destroying America, but I disagreed. The left is consistent and transparent in its belief that big government, higher taxes, and more regulation serve the greater good. The right espouses a limited government platform of lower taxes, less spending, and less regulation, which frees capital resulting in innovation and job creation. But do Georgia Republicans practice what they preach?

The Reality
Georgia's fiscal year 2014 results illustrate the reality vs. the rhetoric. Our revenue jumped $879 million over fiscal year 2013; but $473 million of this increase resulted from the new way cars are taxed. Elimination of the so-called birthday tax made headlines, but Governor Deal never touted the reality of his new ad valorem vehicle tax, Georgia's 2nd largest tax increase in twenty years. Why? He needed more tax revenue to support the $3.5 billion spending increase he has approved since taking office in 2011.

Responsibility for the largest tax increase in the last two decades also resides with Republicans. In 2009, Governor Sonny Perdue and the Republican controlled legislature repealed the Homeowner's Tax Relief Grant. This decision impacted middle and low income Georgia homeowners disproportionally.

After twelve years of Republican rule, Georgians' taxes are higher and state spending is higher.

The Fallout
Georgia was on a roll. From cracking the top twenty in many economic indicators, we have nosedived to the bottom ten if not the bottom five. Due to low paying jobs, only Mississippi has lower average premiums on the 'Obamacare' exchange than Georgia, and only Mississippi has a higher percentage of uninsured people; and, except for Mississippi, Georgia has the highest unemployment rate in the country at 7.8%.

Georgia's growing population is getting poorer. Other Republican led states are outperforming us because they have embraced real tax reform based on lowering state income tax, the most onerous tax for small businesses, our primary job creators. Meanwhile, Georgia's pseudo Republican leadership has no plans to reduce our income tax, the 9th highest in the country.

My Perspective
In the last twelve years, Georgia's Republican leadership has presided over what is arguably the largest economic decline, relative to the rest of the country, since the Civil War. This decline can be reversed if true limited government Republicans have the courage to enact bold policy changes. But the clock is ticking.

This was from an article discussing film credits; “The critique is that while they appear to bring in short-term temporary activity to a state or community, a lot of those benefits flow to the production companies,” says Eileen Norcross, a senior research fellow at George Mason U. “The people who are hired locally tend to be (in) more low-wage service industry jobs.

WHY VOTE LIBERTARIAN?

Sooner or later, every Libertarian candidate hears: “I really like your ideas, and I’d vote for you in a heartbeat if I thought you could win. But—no offense—I don’t think you can. And I’m afraid that voting for you will be taking a vote away from Smith, who may need it to beat Jones. Smith is bad, but Jones is worse.

This is the perennial logic of the “lesser of two evils” voter. But voting for the “winner” doesn’t change anything. Government keeps getting bigger – whether the Democrat or Republican is elected.

Voting Libertarian -– can change everything.

Here are some of the ways your Libertarian vote changes government policy.

1. Policy is often influenced by identifiable voting blocs that never achieve majority status on their own.

How many times over the years have we heard how politicians were courting the black vote or the Hispanic vote? The Catholic vote or the evangelical vote? Soccer moms or NASCAR dads? Such groups exert influence not by becoming numerous enough to win, but by becoming numerous enough and cohesive enough to swing the election from one side to the other.

Liberty-minded voters are already numerous enough to exert that kind of influence, but too many of us throw in the towel on Election Day (either by voting for the lesser of two evils or by staying home). If we want those in power to pay attention to the liberty vote, they have to be able to read our strength in the election results. That means we can’t just talk about liberty and small government during the campaign and then throw up our hands in November. We have to hold out for liberty and small government all the way to the end – and vote Libertarian.

If we do that, incumbents will look for ways to attract us. How? By adopting some of the pro-liberty proposals we advocate. That’s the first practical effect we’re after: less government, and more liberty.

2. The emergence of a sizeable liberty vote influences candidate selection by other opposition parties.

If you’re disappointed that the two old parties have once again both nominated candidates who refuse to cut government spending, who insist that our military should be fighting other people's wars overseas, and who support radical curtailments of our civil liberties (up to and including military arrest and detainment of U.S. citizens on U.S. soil without formal charges or a public trial by jury), this point is for you: The duopoly parties are ignoring you because the party establishments are pretty sure you’ll stay on the trolley no matter which way it’s heading on the road to serfdom. The fastest way to change that is to get off the trolley and prove we have our limits.

The major parties are more committed to acquiring power than they are to any plank of their platforms, and they spend a lot of time worrying about who is “electable.” We can have a major effect on candidate selection if our message is: respect liberty, or get used to losing.

3. Even single-digit showings by Libertarian candidates can dramatically strengthen future Libertarian campaigns.

There are many states where ballot access in the next election depends on how this year's candidates fare at the polls.

4. Voting for liberty candidates affects the way the press covers future elections.

The press has a predilection for “horse race journalism,” covering politics in terms of who is winning or losing, or who is surging or fading. That focus makes public debate narrower than it ought to be during a campaign, and it is almost tantamount to no debate at all where the race is not expected to be close.

Some news organizations do not include Libertarians in their candidate debates, or do not interview Libertarian candidates before making endorsements. All of these practices rest on self-fulfilling prophecies and circular reasoning: Candidate X isn’t considered viable. Why not? No one has ever heard of him. Why not? He doesn’t get any coverage. Why not? He isn’t considered viable. It would be great if we could get the press to stop narrowing public debate this way. But wouldn’t it be a lot easier, and a lot more practical, for all of us who really wish Candidate X could win to simply vote for Candidate X? That would communicate loud and clear that liberty candidates start with a substantial base of support in their communities.

5. Voting Libertarian says that Big Government is unacceptable – and that we demand freedom and small government.

If we use our votes to communicate that we really want to balance the budget, revitalize the economy, end the wars, and restore civil liberties, they become possible. If we don’t, they remain impossible.

If you really want less government and more liberty, vote Libertarian. That’s the only way for you not to waste your vote.

Our ancestors didn’t fight and bleed for your rights to life, liberty, and the lesser of two evils.

Patrick Henry did not thunder for all the ages, “Give me Liberty, or give me whatever everyone else is having.”

Martin Luther King did not stand on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial and tell us, “I have a dream, but I’ll settle for less.”

No. The great ones who have preceded us showed their greatness in their commitment to principle—and in their recognition that the “lesser of two evils” isn’t good enough.

Now it’s your turn to march in that same parade of history. Don’t blow it—your children are watching. Stand up and be counted for the kind of government you’d really like to have. Vote for less government, more liberty, more prosperity, and more security.

609947169125400,"I have been asked how this campaign is different from past Libertarians'. What it boils down to is more person-to-person communication. Here are 3 ways Hunt for Governor is actively working for We the People to take our government back:
1. I am campaigning full-time, while others have had to campaign outside a full-time job. This allows me to spend more time talking to as many people as possible.
2. We are raising more money than past Libertarian candidates have (but not from special interest groups like Deal and Carter). This is enabling us to have enough campaign cards to hand to people when we talk to them.

The majority want change; we just need the majority to know about Hunt for Governor. We need every supporter, volunteer, and follower to have a person-to-person conversation about Hunt for Governor with friends, family, and neighbors.","I have been asked how this campaign is different from past Libertarians'. What it boils down to is more person-to-person communication. Here are 3 ways Hunt for Governor is actively working for We the People to take our government back:
1. I am campaigning full-time, while others have had to campaign outside a full-time job. This allows me to spend more time talking to as many people as possible.
2. We are raising more money than past Libertarian candidates have (but not from special interest groups like Deal and Carter). This is enabling us to have enough campaign cards to hand to people when we talk to them.
3. Most importantly, there are volunteers and communicators in most areas of the state, in order for us to personally reach a broad enough base to succeed.

583861938400590,Great day in Ellijay! Consistent feedback from all corners of the state is that NOW is the time to stand up to the existing big government. Hunt for Governor is a smaller more cost effective choice that maximizes and prioritizes personal freedoms. We can reduce federal influence and restore our great country’s origin of being a republic with liberty and justice for all.
