When we put it in action the truth comes out. I can't wait for the fall out of the tax on 400k people because then the dems will loose the house senate and the white house.

The less you make the bigger the impact on you the taxes will have even if the taxes are on the 400k and up people. Let's use our brains for a change. On paper the tax is on 400k a year people

Prices will go up and Biden will say look I raised on 400k and up and cut for 400k and lower BUT 400k and lower will have less money and we will have more

Lets talk about what is not better. Inflation, taxing to pay for spending - it can and has cause recessions, not taxing anyone making less than 400k a year and cutting taxes for ppl under that"

The point was 12 year Olds are being raped. The government counts every 12 year old that has sex as being raped. If they stop saying yes then that rate would go down. Not disappear

And let me go on record to say I do think we need an increase. We also have to figure out a way to make sure 15 isn't like making 7.
