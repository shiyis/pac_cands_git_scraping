1,2021-05-11 00:59:33+00:00,1391920881878851585,@EcuadorChavez @MarkDavis LOL!  You‚Äôre a ‚Äúclever‚Äù debater.  Turning the sins of yourself into an attack on your opponent.  You are the one who cares not for free speech.  Allowing for government protected (partially) censorship of only Conservative speech.
2,2021-05-10 10:38:22+00:00,1391704158902837248,@EcuadorChavez @MarkDavis Let it take a month.  And let there be more censoring.  Those are less problematic than the anti-Conservative censoring currently going on.  You won‚Äôt scare me into accepting tje current situation where Conservatives get censored but others do not.
3,2021-05-09 02:27:14+00:00,1391218170204233738,"@EcuadorChavez @MarkDavis Now you switch back.  If they have that right to just censor what they wish, then they don‚Äôt deserve special protections.  You can‚Äôt have it both ways.  You get special government protection, then you have to be evenhanded."

5,2021-05-07 13:22:10+00:00,1390658216355368960,@EcuadorChavez @MarkDavis Clearly they‚Äôre ‚Äúresponsible‚Äù for the words of some users. They‚Äôve no trouble censoring Conservatives (by labeling it hate speech). Your mic analogy is misleading. The better comparison is a newspaper. Who is definitely responsible for what is allows people to write on its pages.
6,2021-05-05 23:27:15+00:00,1390085715556544515,@MarkDavis They are indeed free to do as they wish.  But do they deserve Section 230 protections and still do as they wish?  I say no to that question.

87,2020-10-28 01:35:47+00:00,1321264366755434497,"@stevenwdennis Like I told you then.  Move on is fine.  But only if you got something better.  Which we didn‚Äôt it would appear.  Who just ‚Äúmoves on‚Äù when they don‚Äôt have a better thing to replace with?  Unwise people, that‚Äôs who."
88,2020-10-27 11:18:24+00:00,1321048599795535873,"@stevenwdennis Probably not.  But it proves that changing from Garrett in the first place was a mistake.  Didn‚Äôt help us one bit.  Like I‚Äôd told you it wouldn‚Äôt, and you kept insisting it would."
