2,2021-06-25 00:03:00+00:00,1408214105433989126,@whalenonfools I’d recommend getting to know me a little better before you write me off as untrustworthy though
3,2021-06-25 00:01:55+00:00,1408213831864696833,@whalenonfools I’ll take that as a compliment. At least you are demonstrating some notion of discernment.

He  is a huge proponent of gain of function research as well correct? Do you really believe that he had no knowledge of what was going on through a third party entity that provided taxpayer funding to Wuhan"

8,2021-05-19 02:31:16+00:00,1394843067270709248,@RealAdCollector Do you really think a senator only represents his or her state? Fundraising and awareness is done all over the country in federal politics. Do you believe a vote in California to raise your taxes at the federal level doesn’t affect you who may live in Illinois? Interesting

14,2021-04-19 18:54:22+00:00,1384218834467377153,Maxine waters needs to be removed from congress. I’m appalled by her statements that incite violence and division. We need leaders in Washington who work to unite our country-not divide. As the next senator from Ohio I will put country ahead of politics everyday.
