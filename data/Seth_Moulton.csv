The rest of us do: it's too easy for the wrong people to get guns!

Support basic common-sense reforms like red flag laws &amp; expanded background checks &amp; raising the age to purchase.

Take Action!"

There is much we can do that we are not:
* Red Flag Laws
* Stronger background checks
* Raise the purchase age to 21

We must do more. https://t.co/78Z3JfCaGp"
