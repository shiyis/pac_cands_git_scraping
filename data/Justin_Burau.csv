Federal law makes it very clear you cannot make decisions off of race. So with the Chicago Ward maps, why is race the only thing talked about and the deciding factor? How is that legal?"

Ask yourself why we aren't talking about universities paying themselves millions, purchase property tax free and a majority pay ZERO in federal taxes as they hoard billions.
