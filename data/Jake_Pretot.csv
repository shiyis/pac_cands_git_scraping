In every household across this great nation, we sock money in our emergency savings accounts, pay down debt and take a small portion and have a little fun. So why does Washington decide to give money away and increase debt?!? Insanity!"

I would call ceasefire a success for the 12 days, but it hasn't impacted yearly numbers for sure."

You have to remember that the ceasefires are only 12 days out of 365/366 days in a year. That's only 3% of the year. At this point they are positive blips, but need to identify why they work."

Are more people on the streets and therefore perpetrators are more visible and less likely to do bad things? Or is everybody just deciding the need a break?

99,2020-02-22 04:25:33+00:00,1231072510227177475,@MDsteve24 @jemillerwbal So I just read the study and there are ~6000 data points between 2012 and 2019. That's a good sampling. One of the charts clearly shows downward spikes during each of the cease fire weekends. The question is why does this cease fire work? Are more people are on the streets? https://t.co/BhACGNlKtX
