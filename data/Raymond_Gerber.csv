You know the little bit of money you got while a non-American country got the majority.  The country got it but the people of said countries received nothing from it.
77,2022-06-02 13:20:40+00:00,1532351495081009153,@bebe1969 I came here because of a @boredpanda article of a tweet you made. Now I see why you would question found money in a book. You claim republicans vote against helping Americans and yet fail to see all the bills they vote against go to helping other countries or helping the rich.
