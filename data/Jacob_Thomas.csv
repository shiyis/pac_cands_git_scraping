We would all welcome an entrepreneur with similar feelings about civil liberties and the right of business owners.
1,2020-05-09 20:15:16+00:00,1259215378745405440,In El Dorado County we would be appreciative of a large manufacture like Tesla bringing considerable jobs and tax revenue. Let progressives in the Bay enjoy your products and fellow Conservatives enjoy the economic strength. Come out to our county and see the possibilities.

I urge Elon Musk to consider moving his factory to a rural community with a similar understanding of liberty and capitalism #CA04"

If you watch the video you can see one of the students trying to get another student to look at it. Yes it's an inappropriate place for this game to take place. But they weren't flashing white power symbols

You've been trying to impeach the president for the last 3 years and this is the best you have? I can only imagine the case that could be built against you in a few days. If you've done nothing wrong you have nothing to hide.
