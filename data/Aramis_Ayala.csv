As Attorney General I’ll always support women, especially when our health, privacy and freedom are under attack. NOT ON MY WATCH! Florida needs a woman who does what women do best… LEAD https://t.co/7IXtiQDBYZ"

When asked I said- The job of AG is to enforce laws AND the Constitution. Those should align. But right now THAT is the check Floridians need with legislators who bow to a dictator! https://t.co/u0BVeC8De3"
86,2022-05-04 01:11:26+00:00,1521658726310154240,"Tonight I felt the energy to fight back to protect Roe v Wade. I attended @FAPPA rally to speak up about abortion access. I took my daughters so they could hear publicly what I teach privately- that their bodies are theirs. As Americans, privacy and freedom belong to them! https://t.co/Xpqle1QdtK"

89,2022-05-03 02:27:16+00:00,1521315426432471041,We are on the brink of a dark day if SCOTUS overturns Roe v Wade. The decision relegates women to a second class status. It undermines America’s ability to say we are a beacon of freedom for all. As the People’s Lawyer  I’ll fight for rights to safe access to reproductive health.
