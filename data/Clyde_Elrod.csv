10,2019-10-08 01:13:36+00:00,1181377068568911872,"Well I got some good news the district has been changing. The is 120k registered Republicans and 90k registered Democrats. That is a coin toss. If we can get every Democrat to vote, we can flip the 10th!!!"
11,2019-10-08 01:13:14+00:00,1181376974679359488,I hope everyone had a wonderful day. I've been lucky to talk to a lot of Democrats lately. Some seem depressed about how gerrymandered the district is. That there is very little chance of a democrat becoming a congressperson in the 10th.
12,2019-09-29 18:27:54+00:00,1178375865912233984,What  makes you not trust Congress? For me its the lack of transparency.
