The woman that he ran over w/ his car was the mother of his child. She was trying to escape bc he punched her in the face w/a closed fist. Do women not count in your story?

85,2021-07-27 07:33:41+00:00,1419923932224888855,"@andylocal @NYCMayor We also had multiple Level 3 sex offenders at the Hotel Belleclaire, some had raped children as young as age 4 and five, boys and girls. Why not write about why they were dropped off in a hotel that was within 1000 feet from two playgrounds and three schools?"

87,2021-07-15 01:02:02+00:00,1415476716928131074,"@andylocal @LegalAidNYC Andy in your due diligence as you write your next story - can you cover the fact that the homeless in the hotels refuse to get vaccinated and refuse to wear a mask.  Will you inquire about the concerns of the elderly on the UWS, we have a very large population here of seniors."

The children under the age of 12 cannot be vaccinated per the federal government. They depend upon everyone else to be vaccinated to safeguard their health. Do they have any rights to their own health?

Do they have a right to live in a healthy environment?   They are aggressively panhandle by men who will not take the vaccine and refuse to wear a mask. Again, do they have any rights as tax paying citizens?"

They are now claiming they can’t go back to the shelters bc they have not been vaccinated.

Where I live, they REFUSE to wear a mask"

They care about themselves &amp; their community.  I have zero tolerance for anyone who does not receive the vaccine."
