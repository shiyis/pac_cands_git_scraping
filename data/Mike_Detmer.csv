91,2022-01-25 17:56:05+00:00,1486035159212298243,"@GovWhitmer Gretchen, then why did you destroy so many lives with your unconstitutional lockdowns and mandates and why did you execute so many of our vulnerable seniors by placing COVID patients in nursing homes? I believe Michigan will kick you to the curb and not a moment too soon!"

Jeremiah 1:5 backs up life at conception.  Here's a thought, actually crack your Bible and read it. Ask the Holy Spirit for help!!!  You're welcome."
