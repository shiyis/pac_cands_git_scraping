IMHO there‚Äôs a link here to bootstrap mentality &amp; the idea we‚Äôre responsible for everything that happens to them"
84,2022-01-09 18:23:14+00:00,1480243783996477446,"@gaiabiz 3b-The same is true with working families or the poor. Like too many I know personally, these folks can work their hardest and not move up the financial ladder at all."
85,2022-01-09 18:22:39+00:00,1480243639557181442,"@gaiabiz 3a-I‚Äôve heard the argument that CEOs work harder than anyone else for 80 hours a week, but income disparity is HUGE. Can we really compare a CEO work week with a low-income person working three jobs? We know wealthy folks become wealthy through family fortune or other factors."
86,2022-01-09 18:22:02+00:00,1480243480953769994,@gaiabiz 3-How to counter the bootstrap mentality? I‚Äôm not sure I have a good enough answer to this one. I recognize it as an important issue. A belief that hard work lifts one out of poverty is so harmful because it ignores the complexity of soc. &amp; eco factors &amp; its role in one‚Äôs life.
87,2022-01-09 18:16:05+00:00,1480241986493947904,"@gaiabiz 2b - I‚Äôll admit that my vision is pretty ambitious for an MS teacher. Still, I am convinced it can be done in cooperation with government and the private sector, including unions and a reformed education system."
88,2022-01-09 18:15:39+00:00,1480241875273584645,"@gaiabiz 2a - Let‚Äôs also consider how we teach students - K-12 and Higher Ed - both must keep pace with new technologies. I also cannot stress this enough: l learning must be cross-disciplinary, more personalized (Hire more teachers), and it needs to be more focused on human skills."

As an educator, I see many factors that are radically changing how we work, and they are not being addressed head-on, such as automation and the gig economy."
90,2022-01-09 18:12:11+00:00,1480241004414439424,"@gaiabiz 1d - Think of it this way: if no one pays dues, unions have no way to provide any union benefits. And that means lower wages."
91,2022-01-09 18:11:40+00:00,1480240871652134914,"@gaiabiz 1c - Check it out - these ‚Äúright to work‚Äù laws allow workers not to pay union dues, but they are entitled to all the benefits of being in a union. This is wrong! It‚Äôs an underhanded way of destroying unions."
92,2022-01-09 18:10:37+00:00,1480240609831133190,"@gaiabiz 1b - Next, build real penalties for companies that violate labor laws by firing workers who try to organize a union or intimidating others. Critically important is that federal laws must be enacted that pre-empts so-called state ‚Äúright-to-work‚Äù laws."
93,2022-01-09 18:10:08+00:00,1480240486841528322,"@gaiabiz 1a - How do we strengthen unions?
I believe that to get the average Americans a fair share of the gains from economic growth, they need to unionize.
Laws are needed to make it easier to form a union with a simple majority of workers voting up or down."

Students NEED #Recess!
Everyone benefits from a break
Natural light improves wellness
Physical activity feeds the brain
Exercise is healthy

Recess helps students in the classroom because it:
Increases focus
Reduces stress
Develops social skills
