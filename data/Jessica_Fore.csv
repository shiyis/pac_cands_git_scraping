Biden and the old guard are center right classical conservatives, economically/academically speaking. If you want the government to make life more affordable for working people, elect progressives. :)"
79,2022-05-26 15:42:33+00:00,1529850486211362816,"@KyleBartleson Biden has no control over gas prices unless he intervenes in the marketplace. GOP doctrine is leave the market alone &amp; let corporations charge whatever the market will bear &amp; it's not the fed gov't's role to regulate it. Until filling my F350 gets expensive, then blame Dems. :)"
80,2022-05-26 13:45:49+00:00,1529821109016612869,@KyleBartleson U.S. refining capacity is the same level now as in 2014. 17.4M barrels per calendar day.  A barrel of crude is the same as in 2014. $110.  A gallon of gas was $3.60 in 2014.  It's $4.69 now.  It's not a scarcity issue.  It's deliberate price gouging for higher profit margins.
81,2022-05-26 12:54:33+00:00,1529808206339485697,@KyleBartleson The $ per barrel demonstrates scarcity isn't the issue. It's gouging. The $ per gallon is up disproportionately to the price per barrel of crude. It's both a real cost increase and an excuse to raise prices on everything else. Execs are laughing about it on earnings calls.
82,2022-05-26 12:05:07+00:00,1529795767422025730,Crude oil was over $180/barrel in 2008.  A gallon of gas was $4.11.  It was $110/barrel in 2014.  A gallon of gas was $3.60.  It is now $110/barrel.  A gallon of gas is $4.69.  This isn't inflation; it's price gouging.

96,2022-05-24 17:10:32+00:00,1529147850973650944,@NerdAthens The pro life lobby wants a legal doctrine that a fertilized egg is a person (ignoring bodily autonomy‚Äî when does a person have a right to another person‚Äôs body for survival.). The end game is to ban hormonal birth control lest it expel a zygote. Thus more unplanned pregnancies.
