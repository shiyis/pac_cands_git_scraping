Doesn’t want increased production at all in the near term to replace Russian supplies. That has strategic implications if it becomes policy, thank god it’s not how the President is approaching it."
89,2022-04-09 15:40:59+00:00,1512817862389342215,This timed with the release of 240 million barrels of oil from strategic reserves is good policy and it buys the time needed to reroute supplies. “Russia’s First Default in a Century Looks All But Inevitable Now.” https://t.co/kyflbiLEzL

Kunce is most definitely attacking our @NATO friends rather than leveling with Americans about the realities of energy. He’s a threat to the American people as his words supports the goals of China and Russia.
93,2022-04-09 13:44:30+00:00,1512788545106169858,If we want to change we have to starve the beast. Stop political donations to candidates. Start giving to and participating in your committees and clubs.
94,2022-04-09 13:44:29+00:00,1512788543633956869,"One of my observations from the campaign trail. Our entire ""grassroots"" political giving system is just politicians selling their time and presence to the highest bidders. It's not grassroots at all. It's still just rich people manipulating poor people. #TruthMatters"

His message is that we need a white knight to come and save all us poor lgbtq, people of color, and women from the evil Missourians who hate us. You’re the ones propagating hatred.
