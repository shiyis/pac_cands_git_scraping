84,2021-08-04 00:04:35+00:00,1422710019401863168,@SBfut3 It‚Äôs both of their jobs to represent the people. I would not care what they called me and I doubt Biden does either.
85,2021-08-03 23:32:06+00:00,1422701844669808640,@jomeomonke Glad I could help.
86,2021-08-03 23:30:56+00:00,1422701548778528770,@ExcelsiorAR @danielmarans You say this on the very same day that Freshman Rep Cori led the pressure campaign to get Biden to extend the eviction moratorium to October? Turner would‚Äôve been right there with her.

Why do you only care about that last one? ü§î"
88,2021-08-03 23:24:40+00:00,1422699970755497988,@SBfut3 He‚Äôs the president of the United States. If he isn‚Äôt going to work with someone just because they said mean things about him then that says more about him than it does about her. How fragile do you think his ego is?

91,2021-08-03 21:33:49+00:00,1422672076872339460,@john_baison But it‚Äôs the candidate‚Äôs job to bring voters in. If Turner‚Äôs comments would have a meaningful impact in 2020 then Biden should have reached out and tried to address her concerns.
92,2021-08-03 21:29:56+00:00,1422671097556873217,@ChiCyph80 You think Turner won‚Äôt be able to work with Democrats in Congress when she was able to work with Kasich and the rest of the Republican dominated Ohio Government? Seems like Turner does know about coalition building.
