87,2020-08-21 23:47:35+00:00,1296957148522455040,@repblumenauer Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006 put $5.5 billion payment onto USPS.   Can't you suspend the payments?  Permanently or temporarily?  I think this one deserves an direct answer.
88,2020-08-21 23:44:55+00:00,1296956478700494848,@repblumenauer Talked to Portland postal worker on his route yesterday.  He said he is not noticing issues.  Management is because of PERS allocations. $5bil yr.   He said one of his coworkers delivered 220 votes to an empty house during primary. Isn't this open doors for fraud?
