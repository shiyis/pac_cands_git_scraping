1,2022-06-24 16:13:53+00:00,1540367616384147458,"Support candidates who support women by contributing to their campaigns, knocking doors, &amp; getting voters to the polls.  Support organizations on the front lines, such as @PPFA. We cannot fall into despair. We have to take action and get involved, even more than ever before."
2,2022-06-24 16:13:52+00:00,1540367614781833217,"Today is a dark day for our country, for women &amp; especially for women in poverty &amp; for women of color who will be most devastatingly impacted by the Dobbs decision. But we must channel our righteous anger into action. I feel like I’m preaching to the choir, but elections matter."
3,2022-06-24 16:13:52+00:00,1540367612986753025,"But Roe and Casey were decided from a larger fundamental right to privacy. Encompassed in this constitutional right to privacy are other rights, such as the right to use birth control or the right to same-sex marriage. Dobbs is clear that other privacy rights are now insecure."
4,2022-06-24 16:13:51+00:00,1540367611225055232,"By overturning Roe and Casey, the Supreme Court has relegated women to inferior status relative to our male counterparts. We no longer have a right to bodily autonomy. The majority states that abortion is not “deeply rooted” in our country’s history."
5,2022-06-24 16:13:51+00:00,1540367609425788928,"Today’s Dobbs decision is an egregious abomination filled with distortions and faulty reasoning. Roe &amp; Casey recognized a woman’s right to bodily autonomy, and from that, a woman’s right to make her own deeply personal decision about whether she was forced to carry a pregnancy."
