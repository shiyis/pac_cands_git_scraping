""I am determined to defend my rights and maintain my freedom or sell my life in the attempt."" General Nathanael Greene, the ""Savior of the South"". Serving eight years in the Revolutionary war, he would die at the early age of 44 on June 19, 1786 at his Mulberry Grove Plantation in Georgia.
-\-\-\-\-

With the early battles of Lexington & Concord, Rhode Island set up 1500 man militia with Nathanael Greene appointed as Major General. Congress established an army with General Washington named as Commander in Chief (June 14 & 15) immediately followed by the Battle of Bunker Hill. With Bunker Hill, the Continental Army got going with the Continental Congress Commissioning George Washington and other generals. Greene was made a brigadier by Congress.

I look at Greene as Washington's right hand man, fighting the battles, restoring order in Boston after the siege, gathering supplies, and serving as Quartermaster General from 1778-1780.

He wanted to burn the Tory infested New York City, but Congress said no. He was involved with Ft. Washington and Lee, the Battle of Trenton, Brandywine and Germantown . As Quartermaster General he fought at the Battle of Monmouth, Battle of Rhode Island and the Battle of Springfield. He served as commander of West Point. After three different American generals lost the battles of Savannah, Charleston and Camden in the South, General Washington sent Greene down as head of the Southern Command. Dividing into two part with Daniel Morgan as one head and himself on the other, they had successes at the Battle of King's Mountain, Battle of Cowpens, and. They had losses at Guilford Courthouse, Hobkirk Hills and the Siege of Ninety-Six, but even then they kept the British away from its Navy. Eutaw Springs was a toss-up, but forced a British retreat to Charleston.

Greene was the man for the times, and if nothing else, he wore the British down. Following is a short biography of his life. Of course his names is misspelled with an ""i"" instead of an ""a"".

NATHANIEL GREENE.

Nathaniel Greene was born at Potowomut, within the jurisdiction of Warwick, Rhode Island, on the 6th of June, 1742. His ancestors, of good English extraction, were among the first settlers on the banks of Providence River. Having a natural aptitude for study, he spent his extra earnings for books, which trained and developed his mind, as physical toil and out-door sports had strengthened his body. In 1770, being elected to the General Assembly of Rhode Island, he acquitted himself with credit. Foreseeing the struggle with the mother country, he began to prepare himself for an active participation by studying the best military text-books of those times. He married in July, 1774. The following April, the battle of Lexington rendering the war inevitable, Rhode Island promptly responded to the call for troops by raising an army of sixteen hundred men; and in May, 1775, Greene was placed in command as major-general. He showed the good effects of his former preparation by the vigilant drill and thorough discipline of the troops intrusted to his command. By his conduct at the battle of Bunker Hill, he gained the confidence and esteem of Washington. When the different bodies of State troops were reorganized into the Continental army, Greene received a regular commission as brigadier-general on the 22d of June, 1775; but in acknowledgment of his sterling worth, Congress promoted him to the rank of major-general on the 9th of August, 1776. His first regular battle was that at Harlem, when the British, having taken New York, lay siege to Fort Washington. During the subsequent retreat of the Americans through the Jerseys, he was the companion and counsellor of Washington. When defeat was at last changed to victory by the battle of Trenton, he seized the artillery of the enemy and cut off their retreat to Princeton. The American army went into winter-quarters at Valley Forge; and then Greene, yielding to the urgent entreaties of Washington and of Congress, assumed the arduous duties of quarter-master-general, which onerous position he held for two years, with credit to himself, and with inestimable benefit to the army. Greene presided at the “board of inquiry” convened for the trial of André. With regret he signed the decree of the court condemning the young officer to death. The post at West Point left vacant by Arnold’s treason was given to Greene, who took command Oct. 8, 1780. After the defeat of Gates at Camden, Greene was intrusted with the command of the armies of the South, which post he held until the close of the war. At the conclusion of his military career he established himself on a plantation in Georgia, and for the first time in many years enjoyed the opportunity of indulging his love of nature. This tranquil pleasure, however, was short-lived, for through an unfortunate exposure to a Southern sun and the exhalations of a Georgia rice-field, he contracted a malignant fever, from which he died on the 19th of June, 1786, aged but forty-four years. As a man, he was honorable, trustworthy, and patriotic; as a soldier, wise, prudent, brave, and unflinching in the discharge of his duty.

His first regular battle was that at Harlem, when the British, having taken New York, lay siege to Fort Washington. During the subsequent retreat of the Americans through the Jerseys, he was the companion and counsellor of Washington. When defeat was at last changed to victory by the battle of Trenton, he seized the artillery of the enemy and cut off their retreat to Princeton. The American army went into winter-quarters at Valley Forge; and then Greene, yielding to the urgent entreaties of Washington and of Congress, assumed the arduous duties of quarter-master-general, which onerous position he held for two years, with credit to himself, and with inestimable benefit to the army. Greene presided at the “board of inquiry” convened for the trial of André. With regret he signed the decree of the court condemning the young officer to death. The post at West Point left vacant by Arnold’s treason was given to Greene, who took command Oct. 8, 1780. After the defeat of Gates at Camden, Greene was intrusted with the command of the armies of the South, which post he held until the close of the war. At the conclusion of his military career he established himself on a plantation in Georgia, and for the first time in many years enjoyed the opportunity of indulging his love of nature. This tranquil pleasure, however, was short-lived, for through an unfortunate exposure to a Southern sun and the exhalations of a Georgia rice-field, he contracted a malignant fever, from which he died on the 19th of June, 1786, aged but forty-four years. As a man, he was honorable, trustworthy, and patriotic; as a soldier, wise, prudent, brave, and unflinching in the discharge of his duty.
