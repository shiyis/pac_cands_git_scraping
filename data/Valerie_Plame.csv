79,2020-01-06 00:30:29+00:00,1213981124407414784,7/ Bush and Cheney betrayed the American people by lying us into a disastrous war with Iraq. Now the most deceitful president in American history is trying to do it again. I’m running for Congress to help stop him.
80,2020-01-06 00:30:29+00:00,1213981123132289024,6/ The justification for this strike was an “imminent threat.” Yet an array of top military and intelligence officials in the Trump administration have debunked this claim. Generals Kelly and Mattis warned us what would happen with no adult supervision in the White House.
81,2020-01-06 00:30:28+00:00,1213981121777565697,5/ This is not about national security. Trump is willing to ignite a war that could cost the lives of thousands of American troops and innocent civilians around the world in a cynical attempt to distract from impeachment and become a “wartime president” to boost his re-election.

Hopefully, Twitter can still be a force for good."
85,2020-01-06 00:30:27+00:00,1213981115364462592,1/ An “imminent threat.” Fabricated intelligence that will lead to the loss of American lives.  A cynical attempt to become a “wartime president” to ensure re-election. We’ve seen all of this before.
