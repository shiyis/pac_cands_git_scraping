We have a DUTY to support &amp; encourage them to go out, get educated, come back, &amp; spur on rural America. If we don't invest in economic infrastructure in small towns they'll continue to digress. The youth will keep moving away."

88,2022-05-19 13:55:40+00:00,1527286872568844288,@DemTexans The message is that rural Texas should be afforded at the very least urgent care. 36.1 miles was a measurement that is way to far for anyone let alone 3 hours. In Houston you also have urgent care right outside of any subdivision providing med assistance for local citizens.
89,2022-05-19 13:35:30+00:00,1527281794743140352,@DawnBritton13 @PurpleRain713 Healthcare is 1 part of the prob since we‚Äôve made a commodity out of it. Give people a fighting chance. I live in SA &amp; each suburb &amp; just about each shopping center has urgent care. An incident happens at the very least can get there &amp; have ambulance transpo. Critical minutes.
90,2022-05-19 13:21:47+00:00,1527278346576375808,@VivaciousTeapot Please share my message. I started my race early for this specific reason. It‚Äôs time we apply the screws and get the change we so desperately need.

92,2022-05-19 03:37:15+00:00,1527131241123831809,@Brunzealous @saenzmom Very true! I along with a few good people in Texas are about to fight hard to change that. Never lose hope my friend. If we didn‚Äôt have hope we would never desire to cure sicknesses like cancer.

94,2022-05-19 00:36:29+00:00,1527085751741165569,@Jeremy4Texas Unacceptable. I travel through TX and talk to people like in Texline and I ask what happens if someone has a heart attack? They reply we speed to Dalhart and hope not to get pulled over. Those are precious moments one can‚Äôt get back in situations like that. I vow to change that!
95,2022-05-19 00:13:59+00:00,1527080087002152962,Small towns in TX should have 24 hr urgent care at minimum. Basic health infrastructure is a right for rural Texans. Pregnant mothers &amp; people suffering a life threatening event shouldn‚Äôt have to drive 36.1 miles for medical help. These are critical minutes that can save a life.
