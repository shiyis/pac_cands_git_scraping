83,2022-06-12 02:55:40+00:00,1535818087919919104,"@ArkansasTomsBBQ @BernieSanders Definitely need to reign in Government and cut Government spending. Fixing the tax code would help too, especially when we can get the rid of the deficit, get rid of the debt and get rid of the 16th Amendment."
84,2022-06-11 18:18:54+00:00,1535688038768119808,"@KamalaHarris More people are beat to death with hands and feet than killed by rifles.

The problem isn't guns, it's people like you and Joe causing suffering and hopelessness in the country."
85,2022-06-11 18:14:19+00:00,1535686884625633281,@VP How much stock do you have in Pfizer and Madera that you want to subject children to a shot with such a poor percentage of effectiveness?
86,2022-06-11 18:09:47+00:00,1535685742407696388,@RepMullin That's anywhere in Oklahoma. Then we have to take into the account of repair cost on our vehicles from driving on Oklahoma roads. It's clear that neither Republicans or Democrats care about Oklahomans.

89,2022-06-11 15:59:50+00:00,1535653038483963905,"@AndrewYang It has worked out just the way they planned, creating a faux two party system that works to take money from the working class and funnel it to themselves and their wealthy friends.
We need to beak their control on all levels of government. The best way to do that is #VoteGold."
90,2022-06-11 15:55:34+00:00,1535651965107150854,@ArkansasTomsBBQ @BernieSanders The government really thinks it's sweet when they take the taxes out of you're overtime.
91,2022-06-11 15:53:44+00:00,1535651506766086145,"@BernieSanders Not taxing the worker's overtime would help them out.

20 hours of time and a half untaxed would almost make it worth working overtime."
92,2022-06-11 15:40:13+00:00,1535648103675609088,"@MondoBizarro83 @donnieophime @MstrBlstr69 @GlennJacobsTN I'm not sure you understand what the wording ""well-regulated"" ment in the 1700's"" or the it's the Right of the People to keep and bear arms, not the right of the militia."

95,2022-06-10 23:41:51+00:00,1535406924719595520,@AOC Apparently Democrats are going out of their way to keep 3rd party candidates off the ballot. Probably just spending taxpayer money to protect their own interests there though.
96,2022-06-10 23:37:03+00:00,1535405714423914497,@ShaneTHazel @RealSpikeCohen It's actually around .03 now.
97,2022-06-10 23:32:56+00:00,1535404678674010118,"@KamalaHarris No 86 year old should have to fear being arrested for using marijuana to treat a medical condition. 

No 9 year old should be forced to sit still for 8 hours a day just to be taught to only take a break when told.

No 18 year old should be sent to fight half way around the world."
98,2022-06-10 23:24:25+00:00,1535402536047345667,@ComicDaveSmith @RealSpikeCohen @ComicDaveSmith you need to upgrade that graph. Last I looked it was $0.03.
99,2022-06-10 23:15:43+00:00,1535400345089851395,@14karatdjs @AOC It's different when it innocent store owners suffering than it is when people actually protest against those who have caused the problem.
