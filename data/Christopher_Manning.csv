In 1944 SCOTUS got Korematsu wrong and it took decades to get it right. The same is true for 2A. The court got it wrong for decades, now correcting it. https://t.co/o4c3ByfNo2"

Take 20% off the TSA budget and hire more Air Marshals. Locking the pilots cabin has made a hijacking highly unlikely to happen again.
