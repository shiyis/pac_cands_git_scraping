97,2021-11-04 04:11:57+00:00,1456111954049835010,@YoungPiccasso @brgridiron @MikeSilver Baker gave life to the Browns before OBJ. OBJ is toxic to organizations. Ask the Giants. They won Super Bowls before him. Once OBJ showed up zero. Now he is with the browns and the drama follows him. Waive his ass or drop him. Let's another sucker hire him.
98,2021-11-04 04:06:02+00:00,1456110464048455682,@TampaBayTre It's because OBJ is toxic. His athletism is useless on the field. His antics are that of a child. From his father's post the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. He will never help a team make any kind of playoff. He just wants to be a celebrity. No defenders fear OBJ. Waive him
