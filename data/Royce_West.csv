Iâ€™ve been to rural Tx and seen how far some of these schools are from law enforcement. Local leaders felt this could help rural schools in the event of gun violence. I favor local control, and local schools get to decide."

Saying the Gadsden flag had been fully co-opted as a symbol of hate a full year before my opponent metaphorically wrapped herself in it by making it her profile pictureâ€”and making the point an observant person would have known this.
89,2020-07-07 21:40:10+00:00,1280617629619757062,You cannot explain away making this your profile pictureâ€”your PUBLIC FACEâ€”on social media in 2015 and saying you only thought of the military connotation when you saw the flag on TV daily used as a symbol for hate. A day to respond and thatâ€™s your spin? https://t.co/aJJM5zNeuM

By 2015 when she made it her profile picture (tell the truth, now, it wasnâ€™t just a post), the Gadsden flag had been fully associated w/ far right extremism."
