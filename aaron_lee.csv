The MS legislation allowed the passage and adoption of another instance of “double dipping” federal funds. Broadband adoption in rural communities. By leasing of lines being ran by co-ops and the likes to internet providers. Thus enabling them to provide their own service whilst enabling the use of their lines as well. Where’s that money going? It better not be said to infrastructure, as it’s already in place, or to maintaining, as that’s not how a GPON network they use works.

Here’s food for thought; instead of simply complaining about how the federal government spends too much, or how overreach of it by taxing and the likes; why doesn’t the state legislature simply refuse the money allotted in excess of $4billion for example in MS, and advise it be used instead on paying off the debt? Oh wait. Because free money is free money right? Wake up. Stop listening to pitches from politicians and listening to your own understanding and accounting for the reasons. Silence on the issue often means you made them unable to answer due to ignorance.","Instead of spending money “we don’t have,” why not send it back?","Aaron Lee for MS HOUSE 4

I didn't lie; after this, I'm really retiring regardless of outcome. Am I just giving myself unwarranted stress then?

These same ones regarded me as a drug addict, an alcoholic, “trash.” Yes, for you that know my family, that was actually said. They can answer to it not me.

The ability to jump back and forth, party to party? Yeah, most of those same democrats jumped over and became a Republican. Do your own research instead of just listening to me. You still see it happening from time to time.

But I’m done worrying myself to death over all of you and the shape of our country. Count on it. Cast me aside, dismiss me, label me crazy or irrational, or listen because the choice is ultimately out of mine… just please… make it wisely.

I’m taking the next few days to relax. No campaigning nor posts. I've gathered my signatures and will be on the ballot. As if you people read them.

I just read an article where Biloxi PD alleged a man was “threatening people in a parking lot with a knife.” They supposedly “approached” the individual as in to my understanding he was casually walking around due to this description, and he took off running after being “challenged.” It ended in the woods where a “gun was discharged.” He later died of multiple gunshot wounds.

So; I’m not here to bash police. At all. I’m a veteran and I’ve got nothing but respect for those that lay down their lives every day foreign and domestic. Having said that, I’ve been trying to find the right way to ensure accountability, protection, and being capable of continuing their jobs. I personally thought qualified immunity was idiotic when I first heard of it. Will it ever get pushed? Logically you’ve got millions funneled against it but hey we could go for it should that be the majority’s take if I were elected.

Separating from that I had an idea; instead of allowing police officers to carry firearms, they can only carry non-lethal measures to get uncooperative to comply. Subjectively they call for back up anyways when things get dicey, so the numbers are in their favor. If for some reason a firearm would be needed, they could call for a team professionally trained to handle said situation. Kind of like SWAT; segmented from their departments. Not only would it provide a window of logical reasoning to exist between determining if deadly force is needed, while also enabling a shoot-to-incapacitate as they’d have the formal training to render this.

Don’t just throw out or ignore, all you “conservatives.” Yet again, you can say you’re a conservative but what are you really trying to conserve here in MS. Can’t tell me things need changing. I’m trying to be levelheaded consider doing it yourself for once. I’m neither a liberal nor conservative. Just a rationally thinking person who wants to explore all avenues for the best choice. Don’t say “police need firearms to protect themselves..” I walk the streets every single day without a firearm. I have extensive training in operations and urban warfare. I’m more trained than majority of officers serving. I’m capable of defending myself without one; we are basing our individual freedom to be able to walk openly carrying a firearm right now in this country because they somehow think every citizen is trying to murder them. I’m the one rationalized to be guilty prior to any indication otherwise if I’m openly carrying, and risk being shot just because they don’t know how to handle situations effectively. Majority of open carrying individuals are law abiding. The one in 100? I’d rather have someone who’s signed up just as I did knowing you could die protecting, than another possible innocent life being taken. Regardless of what that man has done, he’s got a right to trial and innocent until proven otherwise. Treat him as such.

Any/all ideas are welcome if logical and rational. I’m personally not wasting any more time banging my head against a wall trying to convince people to see both perspectives and not just their own stubbornness and ego overriding.

So different kind of posting; I’m wanting your opinion on the highlighted portions of the pictures. I, personally, am not a fan of this current administration or his policies, but I will openly state what he supposedly said here is EXACTLY how I feel about what our Constitution defines as liberty; non-imposing freedoms as a right.

Regardless of how you feel about issues, which ironically is why I’m so passion fueled for running for political office as an Independent nonetheless, is reminding people what we thought was fought, paid for in blood, sacrificed over, and boasted about as being “land of the free” yet global dockets mark us as 28 on individual freedoms indexes. So remaining unbiased, I believe is absolutely crucial to public representation of a democratic government. Hence; if you’re unable to do that, YOU’RE PART OF THE PROBLEM.

Societal views constantly evolve, shift, and better research/understanding gives way to higher individual responsibilities. So for once in a blue moon I agree with President Biden on this; it’s not true representation if you boast liberty and freedom whilst stripping away the very choice and forcing ideologies. Regardless. Abortion is slightly different in terms of what qualifies as being affordable protection of freedoms, but ultimately you’re stripping another’s choice to choose. If choice is something you’re unfamiliar with, I kindly point you to any church in south MS where they’ll preach openly about the choice God provides. Is it not sane thinking it goes to reaffirm our accountability for our own actions and not another’s?

Just curious how others process this in terms of understanding, not judging in the slightest. As always, this should be publicly allowable expression of your thoughts, and not argumentative but researched/thorough backing. Not just spewing what your grandpappy said.",Just curious;,"Aaron Lee for MS HOUSE 4

Continuing to spread and share likeminded views of countless individuals I meet. I was told today how refreshing it was to see someone dedicated to a cause. Before next November, I WILL ensure everyone is informed and I’m transparent as possible. Less government oversight, more true liberty, and a voice FOR THEREFORE BY the people.

A public announcement as well; I’m all for vaccinations by CHOICE, not mandated. Simply something to be aware of for all who get flu vaccinations; there’s a mixture of pharmaceutical companies developing a mixed COVID/influenza vaccination that’s in late trials. Something to be aware of heading into the season.

Please share the page, spread awareness, and let’s keep the momentum up! Thanks to all!","Check out the page or perhaps the website. Apologies for a few typos though, as no excuse, but I’m giving it my all. Thanks 😊","Aaron Lee for MS HOUSE 4

558177541910567,"Please, don’t just glance by and not read. My fellow Americans. I’ve decided it’s time for me to turn my attention to giving back to this country even more. I’m running for MS Congressional District 4 as an Independent. Not because I don’t agree with Republican or Democrat platforms, but because I have and always will feel the representation of the people should be just that; not dictated and divided by political party. We’ve seen first hand what segregation does in this country, yet still maintain that line with party affiliation. It does nothing to influence and maintain the true principles of democratic government.

I’m going door to door starting in Biloxi spreading my message and sharing in the frustration of our “leaders.” I stand anxiously awaiting my fellow candidates if they feel so bold, to debate me. I’ll happily educate them in the federal constitution as well as the state constitution some of them are actually representing and their ravaging of its principles. They’ve designed a system in which few have voice, yet radiate with forceful authoritarianism. The sheer fact of what we witnessed ourselves in MS is an open testament to their corruption. If it were up to me, I’d have every one dragged through the streets and tried for treason. The constitution (state) clearly states in 273 sub. 11 legislatures are not to impeded on these powers, yet even in the very ruling the court ruled of their ignorance to uphold that which they are obligated to. Unfortunately, due to it being state, the feds will just push it down back to state, and thus the cycle continues. I, for one, am done with it without at least showing my discernment over it.

NO person should be serving more than 2 terms as a rep. Truly. It will ensure less corruption and applicable accountability to ensure stale ideals in an evolving world. I’m sorry, but as a rep, you should have NO bias toward any legislation considered; only the belief and reasoning of your constituents. Which leads me to another key ingredient..

For the past few weeks I’ve been developing an app to showcase alongside my campaign. One that truly will return democracy and power to the ones it represents. It’s an app with a direct interface between your individual congressional district and the ones representing it. After verification you are a participating elector in that district, you’ll have the ability to submit your vote on EVERYTHING. From floor votes, appropriations, bills, etc. The rep will input each document for the public to discuss, gain clarity of, and decide what that rep should vote in favor of. It will be then fair and transparent if the rep is not representing his constituents. Since we are in a modernized world, a notification will be delivered when new material has been added for review on your end. Once submitted in form of a “yay” or “nay” you’ll be able to view the overall results in live time as well as the rep providing a result of floor vote. The list of individuals will have ONE account per registered elector publicly accessible by circuit clerk and tax record. Due to new voters coming of age, upon registration to vote, they will receive an account as well; it will update nightly. You will not have to worry on if your result or privacy will be broken; you will have the choice as to a public account or anonymous.

That’s just a sampling as it will all be elaborated on within the coming months. I ask each of you to share the group “Aaron Lee for Mississippian Congressional District 4.” It’s high time we take back our democracy and return the actual representation back to the people. Representation was meant for those unable to travel to voice their concerns. Now you as the people will be in charge. Thank you and I will respond to those with any questions.","Please, don’t just glance by and not read. My fellow Americans.
