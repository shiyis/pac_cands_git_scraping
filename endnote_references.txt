	In this paper we sketch an attempt at computer simulation of individual belief systems. Although rooted in a series of earlier formulations (Abelson and Rosenberg [1958],1 Abelson [1959],2 Rosenberg and Abelson [1960],3 Abelson [193]), this complex project has not heretofore been totally outlined in print. We shall begin with several clarifying comments on the nature of our goals and the problems we have faced, thence proceeding Further and...

	We develop a probabilistic model of legislative data that uses the text of the bills to uncover lawmakers' positions on specific political issues. Our model can be used to explore how a lawmaker's voting patterns deviate from what is expected and how that deviation depends on what is being voted on. We derive approximate posterior inference algorithms based on variational methods. Across 12 years of legislative data, we demonstrate both improvement in heldout predictive performance and the model's utility in interpreting an inherently multi-dimensional space.

	The l-bfgs limited-memory quasi-Newton method is the algorithm of choice for optimiz-ing the parameters of large-scale log-linear models with L 2 regularization, but it can-not be used for an L 1 -regularized loss due to its non-differentiability whenever some pa-rameter is zero. Efficient algorithms have been proposed for this task, but they are im-practical when the number of parameters is very large. We present an algorithm Orthant-Wise Limited-memory Quasi-Newton (owl-qn), based on l-bfgs, that can efficiently optimize the L 1 -regularized log-likelihood of log-linear models with millions of parame-ters. In our experiments on a parse re-ranking task, our algorithm was several or-ders of magnitude faster than an alternative algorithm, and substantially faster than l-bfgs on the analogous L 2 -regularized prob-lem. We also present a proof that owl-qn is guaranteed to converge to a globally optimal parameter vector.
